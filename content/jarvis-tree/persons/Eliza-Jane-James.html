<h3>Eliza (Jinnie) James</h3>

<p style="background: palegoldenrod; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
<br>
Eliza Jane married Arthur Harold Jarvis and had six children:
<br><br>
Keith :	b 18-10-1891 	d 10-12-1916<br>
Harold Arthur :	b 01-08-1894 	d 22-09-1956<br>
Eric Roy : b 02-08-1896 	d 13-11-1967<br>
Reginald Lancelot :	b 13-04-1899 	d 05-11-1883<br>
Leslie Douglas : b 18-02-1904 	d 09-04-1984<br>
Majorie Edith Alice : b 24-09-1909 	d 1993<br>
Keith : single<br>
<br><br>	
Arthur was not a good husband, father or provider for his wife and family. He had many &quot;lady&quot; friends and was often absent for long periods from the family home, not supporting them emotionally or financially. 
<br><br>
.. Eliza was a small, quiet woman, a good sewer of clothes and managed to keep the family fed and clothed only through her own efforts. She had a disappointing, unhappy hard life trying to make ends meet. She lived within her own
thoughts and used to sing to herself as she went about her daily chores.
<br><br>
In 1915 when his father, Arthur and three brothers, Keith, Harold and Roy, enlisted in
World War I, Eliza (Gran) was left at home with Reg (who was not accepted in the forces because he had varicose veins), Les and Marjorie.
<br><br>
Marjorie worked in the office of Lensworth Finance. She became secretary to the Chief
Executive, holding the position until her retirement. Her mother Eliza lived with Marj
and Gordon for several years before her death in 1955.
<br><br>
Reg was Postmaster at Robe, Pinaroo, Loxton, Portland and Mildura and relief staff at Adelaide GPO. He and his family had many moves over the years. They were living at Loxton when Eliza went to stay with them and died at Loxton on 26/6/1955 aged 86.

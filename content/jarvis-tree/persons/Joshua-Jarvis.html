From the book by Beryl Jarvis :<br><br>

On the 10th June, 1851 the sailing ship “Reliance” sailed from Plymouth, in the United Kingdom with 392 immigrants bound for South Australia some 19,000 klms. It arrived at Port Adelaide on the 19th September 1851.<br><br>

Notes on the voyage written by the Rev. W. Gray to the Archivist in Adelaide, dated 5th March, 1934 are as follows:<br><br>

Three months, with nothing but water around them, living on pickled pork, salt junk, bouilli soup, and a cupful of pure Jamaican lime juice, (sweetened with black sugar to prevent skurvy), once a week. They went too far south. Icy tangles half a yard long hung from the shrouds, the bulwarks were frozen till they were like solid wire. Some of the passengers who had too little clothing had to go to bed to keep warm. The passengers were called up to help crew set sails to “bout ship”.<br><br>

On board was a 19 year old young man with the name of Joshua Jarvis travelling unaccompanied.<br><br>

On board was a family of Barretts' who were rumoured to be distant relatives to Joshua. It was the family of George Barrett, however Mary Ann's name did not appear on the manifest. I have yet to prove that these Barrett's are our family ancestors.
On the 20th January, 1855 at St. Stephens Church of England at Willunga, Joshua now aged 22, married Mary Ann Barrett aged 16 years. Joshua signed his name and Mary Ann made her mark (X). The name of the officiating Minister was Arthur Bernard Burnett and two witnesses were George Barrett and Emma Risenborough.<br><br>

The name of the parents of both Joshua and Mary Ann were not recorded which is unusual as Mary Ann was not of legal age – therefore needing permission of her father. It is interesting to note that George Barrett and Emma Risenborough married on 18th August, 1859 at the home of his father John Barrett at Inman Valley.<br><br>

Residences for Joshua and Mary Ann Jarvis have been listed to include : Encounter Bay, Victor Harbor, Inman Valley, Bald Hills, Claire, and Jamestown. His occupation was listed as farmer, religion Church of England.<br><br>

Joshua and Mary Ann had the following children:<br><br>

&emsp;Edwardb 25 Aug 1858 Enc Bay d 1917 Meningie<br>
&emsp;Ellen Marie	b 14 Sep 1860 Sheoak Hills<br>

&emsp;Edith Jane b 3 Aug 1870 Yankalilla<br>

<br>

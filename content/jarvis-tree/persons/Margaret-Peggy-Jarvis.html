Harold Jarvis - married a local girl, Isobelle, known as Belle Whiting and they lived at Port Elliot, a few miles south of Victor Harbor. Belle died on 23/3/1959. They had one daughter named "Peggy” who married Adrian Ottaway and they had five children, the eldest was killed a road accident, twin girls deceased and Gillian is sadly what people call a “bag lady” in Victor Harbor. (Information given to me by David Jarvis in June 1997).

The headstone inscription of the grave for <a href="https://map.billiongraves.com/grave/Peggy-OTTAWAY/12893026">Peggy and Adrian</a>
in the Victor Harbor cemetary reads :
<br><br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
Beloved husband of PEGGY
<br>
Died 10th May 1985 Aged 68 years
<br>

<br><br>
Although the inscription is unclear it does appear to read 13 children.
<br>
Also the headstone for Peter Livingstone Ottaway reads :
<br><br>

<br>

This confirms the number of children but details are as yet not found.

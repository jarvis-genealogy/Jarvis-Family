Notes:<br>
The records have been taken from the book by Beryl Jarvis.<br>
Although her record does not agree with familysearch.org, particularly the Jarvis family<br>
<a href = "https://www.familysearch.org/tree/pedigree/landscape/LX3R-51J" target="blank">https://www.familysearch.org/tree/pedigree/landscape/LX3R-51J</a> (You have to sign in to see this but it's free).<br>
At the time of writing, the details are conflicting and have not been confirmed.
However, Beryl goes into some detail about the family in Denbigh Wales and Monmouth, Pows and her research is credible. She writes :<br>
It was in the town of Denbigh, Efenechtyd, Wales - a market town in the County of Denbighshire (west of Chester) - on the 21 June 1828, Edward Jarvis married Jane Roberts.

(3) MONMOUTH, Powys — At the place which is now called Monmouth, the Romans established a military base called Blestium. Several centuries later, the Normans built a castle, which was eventually destroyed during the Civil War, and Monmouth Bridge, is a fascinating survival, the only Norman fortified bridge remaining in Britain. Its 13th century tower formed one of the four medieval gates to the town. The castle was the birthplace of the future Henry V. A statue on the 18”‘ century Shire Hall serves as a reminder. Monmouth’s second most famous son was born ir1 1877, C. S. Rolls, who is one half of the famous partnership of Rolls-Royce. Places of interest include the Naval Temple on Kymin Hill, a pantheon to a galaxy of admirals and naval heroes.

Notes:<br>
The records have been taken from the book by Beryl Jarvis.<br>
Although her record does not agree with familysearch.org, particularly the Jarvis family<br>

At the time of writing, the details are conflicting and have not been confirmed.
However, Beryl goes into some detail about the family in Denbigh Wales and Monmouth, Pows and her research is credible. She writes :<br>
It was in the town of Denbigh, Efenechtyd, Wales - a market town in the County of Denbighshire (west of Chester) - on the 21 June 1828, Edward Jarvis married Jane Roberts.

Alice was first of four childern to  Frederick James Scott and Lily May Pearce and is the link from the Jarvis family to the Scott and Pearce families. More detail can be found in the <a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Jarvis-Family/content/scott-tree.html">Scott Family</a> descendency chart.
<br><br>
Alice and Roy had 2 children, Keith and Shirley. Keith married Shirley Sanderson from Port Augusta, and they had three children - Lynn, Coralie and Ian.
<br><br>
Roy was a telegraphist and, as required by his work, the family lived in several places including Adelaide, Darwin, Cook and Orroroo. Of great interest are her experiences at Cook on the Nullarbor Plain in an <a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Jarvis-Family/content/Cook-Stories.html">interview with Neil Quintrell</a>
<br><br>
Alice later moved to a retirement village in Melbourne where she became the oldest living resident.<a href="https://jarvis-genealogy.github.io/Jarvis-Family/content/jarvis-tree/images/Alice-May-Story.jpg">Her story can be found here.</a>

Jarvis family GEDCOM

The descendency charts for the Jarvis and Scott families have been reproduced in a more traditional manner using a genealogy application for Windows "My Family Tree" by Chronoplex Software. https://chronoplexsoftware.com/myfamilytree/index.htm. This program has extensive capabilities, is offered free of charge, is ad-free and also distributed on the Microsoft Store.

The primary aim here is backup. However, the GEDCOM file will also load immediately into "My Family Tree" and other software that supports this format.

Importantly, the GEDCOM export includes images as part of the export. Geneaology sites also provide export with images, but the image files remain on their server.

Two versions are archived here. GEDCOM 5.5 for compatibility with older software : "Jarvis_mft.ged" and the "Jarvis_mft" folder. GEDCOM 7.0 which also provides for a compressed "gdz" archive file : "Jarvis_mft.gdz". Both will import equally well.

This program has extensive capabilities, is offered free of charge, is ad-free and also distributed on the Microsoft Store.

This program provides for export of the entire tree as GEDCOM file (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM) which can be imported into any software that supports the format.

Importantly, the export includes image files. Genealogy sites often also provide export with images, but the image files can remain on their server.

The primary aim here is backup, but the file will also load immediately into "My Family Tree" to explore, rather than by way of the descendency charts. However, pages for individuals and links to further information are not included.

You can also view the tree in a more traditional way that opens up different families as you explore. I have made a duplicate using "My Family Tree" software which is lightweight, free of charge, ad-free and and works quite well. Maybe you are interested to have a look. The main idea is that it produces a "GEDCOM" format file that is universally recognized for import and makes an ideal backup.

1) Download and install "My Family Tree"

https://chronoplexsoftware.com/products/index.htm

2) Download the exported "GEDCOM" file

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ihjNYfW7gEgpouTsq4wTHA--uKoHmVnB/view?usp=sharing

3) Unzip to get a new folder :
      GEDCOM-EXPORT
         Jarvis_mft (image folder)
         Jarvis_mft.ged (the exported file)
         
4) Open "My Family Tree" and click on "Import GEDCOM".
    Find "Jarvis_mft.ged" that you just extracted and "Open"
    You will be centred on Joshua Jarvis and Mary Ann Barrett.
  
5) Before looking at it, save as a family tree format file
    File > Save as > new name
 
6) Drag to move down one level and left to find Arthur - Eliza
   Left more and down one level will find Eric Roy - Alice
   Click on Each person for their details and relationships.
  
7) To re-open you can select "Open recent" instead of loading the gedcom data again.

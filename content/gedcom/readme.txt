Jarvis family GEDCOM

The descendency charts for the Jarvis and Scott families have been reproduced in a more traditional manner using a genealogy application for Windows,  My Family Tree, by Chronoplex Software (https://chronoplexsoftware.com/myfamilytree/index.htm). This program has extensive capabilities, is offered free of charge, is ad-free and also distributed on the Microsoft Store.

This program provides for export of the entire tree as GEDCOM file (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM) which can be imported into any software that supports the format.

Importantly, the export includes image files. Genealogy sites often also provide export with images, but the image files can remain on their server.

The primary aim here is backup, but the file will also load immediately into "My Family Tree" to explore, rather than by way of the descendency charts. However, pages for individuals and links to further information are not included.

Three are several GEDCOM formats. The one provided here is the latest GEDCOM 7.0 which provides for a compressed archive file "Jarvis_mft.gdz". For compatibility with older software, import to "My Family Tree" and export again as GEDCOM 5.5 including multimedia.

<h2 id="section2">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>Look at our past, look at the present and look to the future.</h3>

<p>

I am not endowed with any great talent as a writer, however, using my computer, I have put together the knowledge and background which I have gained, from many years of research about the Jarvis and James families.
<br><br>
Most importantly I want to record and share with our children Jennifer and Steven, our grandchildren, Daniel, Cameron, Tracey and Nuin Tara, the pioneer spirit of our
ancestors, the hardships they endured and the contribution they made towards the
settlement of South Australia. They left their homeland with very few possessions
knowing they would have no hope of ever returning to or seeing their loved ones again, to take advantage of the promise of a better “life" in a land across the world.
<br><br>

I begin with the generation that came to Australia, where they came from, the families they left behind and the generations that have been born here.
<br><br>

Joshua Jarvis was born in Wales and came out as a young man on his own. I spent many years looking for the family in Norfolk as stated in South Australian records. This was incorrectly recorded. I finally found the family in Denbigh, Wales. His wife Mary Ann Barrett came from Norfolk. Once again after many years of looking in that county and nearby Suffolk, I have not yet found where she was born. As new and better records become available, not to mention the time to pursue them, I will one day find her birth place and siblings.
<br><br>

Abel James was born in Abergavenny, Wales. On our trip to England in 1979 we
particularly noticed the town of Abergavenny, mainly because of a huge old building
overlooking the town. On inquiring we were told it had been used in earlier years as the “looney bin” for the nearby counties and was currently used as a hospital. Little did we know then that our family ancestor Abel had been born in this town. He married Mary Ann Mills who arrived in S.A. with her parents when only two years old, from Redruth, Cornwall. They settled in Balaklava where they raised their family.
<br><br>

As I travelled backward through the years, I have developed a greater understanding and discovered physical appearances and traits of character, which tell us why we are as we are. Where possible I have tried to give the cause of death because the genetic factors are so important to our present day health.
<br><br>

It has been a personal delight to me to renew contact with members of our extended
family. Life goes on and we tend to drift apart but this project has served to draw us
together once again for which I am grateful.

<h2 id="section4">THE JARVIS NAME</h2>

<h3>How the old and distinguished JARVIS family got its name and what the
<br>
JARVIS NAME MEANS.</h3>

<p>
The surname of Jarvis appears to be patronymical in origin. Research indicates that it can be associated with the English meaning “descendant of Gervais or Gervase - spear or servant”.
<br><br>
Although this interpretation is the result of onomastic research, you may find other
meanings for the Jarvis family name. Many names have more than one origin, e.g. the
English surname of “Bell” may designate someone who lived or worked at the sign of the bell, or it may refer to a bellringer or bellmaker.
<br><br>
Extensive research on the Jarvis name may prove difficult to find the exact spelling which is used today. It may very well have been spelt differently hundreds of years ago, or it may have been changed somewhere along the line. The more research you do, the more likely you will be to find different spellings. Language changes, carelessness and a high degree of illiteracy compounded the number of ways which might have been used. Sometimes the man himself did not know how to spell his own name correctly. Often the person recording the name spelt it the way it sounded to him.
<br><br>
Spelling variations of the family name - knowing that different spellings of the original
surname are a common occurrence, it is not surprising that the probable variations of the Jarvis surname to be Jarvis, Jervis, Jervios, Jervoise, Gervase and Gervis.
<br><br>
Although bearers of the old distinguished Jarvis name comprise a small percentage of
individuals living in the world today, there may be a large number of your direct relations who are using one of the Jarvis name variations.
<br><br>
<i>
As I write of days long ago in a different life, in a different world, to say that the past
doesn’t matter, it’s what happens now that matters, this is what is important. That is right too, because the past only lives in our memories and cannot be changed. It is the present that we need to take into account, the day, the minute, the hour. That’s what we live in the present, however, what has happened before us touches our lives, it’s our inheritance, it’s in our genes, it makes us what we are.

<h2 id="section6">WALES</h2>

<h3>THE JARVIS FAMILY IN WALES, ENGLAND</h3>

<p>
WALES in the western part of England, is bounded on the east by England, on the north by the Irish Sea, on the south by Bristol Channel, and on the west by St. George’s Channel. Since 1536, it has been politically integrated with England, with which it forms part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It retains, however, cultural characteristics which distinguish it from England.
<br><br>
Wales is almost entirely an upland region, Snowden Massif in Caernarvonshire has five
peaks, the highest of which is 3,560 ft., and is the highest point in England and Wales. The main river is the Dec. The coast line is rugged and irregular, indented by many wide bays, of which Cardigan Bay is the widest.
<br><br>
The earliest known inhabitants were a slight, short dark people, possibly of Iberian origin. Before the end of the Bronze Age the country was overrun by Celts who were developing the use of iron. When the Romans came to Britain in the fourth century they found it necessary to build forts along the Welsh border to protect their British province from sporadic inroads. With the departure of the Romans early in the ﬁﬁh century the Welsh tribes began swarming down into the  English midlands. They came into conflict with the Anglo-Saxon invaders from the east and were driven back into their hilly strongholds. Eventually the Anglo-Saxons drove wedges to the north and south of Wales, separating the Welsh from the Celts of Cornwall and northern England.
<br><br>
It was Edward I, who ruled from 1272 to 1307, who was successful in overthrowing the leading Welsh chieftains and in 1282 Llwelyn Prince of Wales, was killed. To keep the country in subjection Edward built a number of castles and in 1301, he created his own son Edward, Prince of Wales. Since then the male heir to the English throne has been known by the title “Prince of Wales".
<br><br>
For a century British law and the English language became predominant. This naturally aroused the antagonism of the Welsh. It wasn’t until 1536 that Wales became an integral part of the Tudor Kingdom but retained its identity as a principality within the kingdom.
<br><br>
Wales passed through the Reformation of the sixteenth century easily, and became attached to the Archbishop of Canterbury. It was deeply affected, however, by the Evangelical Revival . This was due chiefly to the efforts of a Welsh hymn writer and Methodist preacher, William Williams. This movement influenced not only the religious life of the country but also its cultural and political outlook and was largely responsible for arresting the tendency to substitute English for Welsh. The result was that Wales was more successful than Scotland and Ireland, in retaining the language of the country. Today almost one third of the people speak both English and Welsh, while about three per cent speak only Welsh.
<br><br>
The Industrial Revolution during the late eighteenth century had a profound effect on
Welsh life because of the rich deposits of coal and iron in the southern part of Wales.
Today many other industries and tourism add to the economy of Wales. (<i>Ref. Collier’s Encyclopedia Book 23 Page 217-219</i>)

<br>

<h3>The Spirit and the Face</h3>

<p>
Wales is an extraordinary mixture of the obvious and the recondite, a country of romantic legends and mined castles, yet the overpowering spirit of the landscape is one of Gothic drama - a wild mountainous terrain of vast, cloud-misted distances, pervaded by the sound of sweet water and birdsong. Here is a depth of vision leading you into the center of an almost untouchable world of clear light and exhilarating vista  - a land where curlews flock in their thousands to feed upon damp moorland, their wild plaint, at first joyous and then of long despairing lament, seems to haunt Wales eternally.
<br><br>
In the days of the Princes, Wales was always regarded as three entities, the Northern
Kingdom of Gwyneddt, the Middle Kingdom of Powis, and the Southern Kingdom of
Deheubarth. Powis was never a very strong power and seldom stood by its own might,
nowadays it is only a vague historical memory. Not so, however, the other two, Wales is only a unified country in the mind of the idealist - in practice it is divided into North and South. The division is precise and occurs at the River Dovey, this point is a boundary not only of Welsh feeling - between the Anglicized lands of South Wales, and the spirit of Celtic individualism which has been the hallmark of the Northern lands since the 13th century - but scenery also, the sharp mountains of the Cambrian Range lying to the north of the Dovey, whilst smoother, less dramatic mountains spread southwards across the Deheubarth landscape.
<br><br>
In Southern Wales history delivered a hammerblow to Welsh nationhood by the gradual inroads made by Norman Marcher Lords who extended English conquest from the mouth of the Wye as far west as Pembrokeshire’s Atlantic headland. Along this fief, part of which is still referred to as “Little England beyond Wales,” are found the ruins of the most impressive castles in Wales - with a host more on a lesser scale of grandeur. Everywhere along this feudal tract the Norman and English cultures dominate - fine stone houses were constructed magnificent churches were raised: and towns on the old English plan were built.
<br><br>
As the south coast has its line of castles stretching from Marches to the ocean boundary, so has the northern seaboard a string of impregnable fortresses. But these are of quite a different order. The former were as much baronial mansions as fortresses, whilst the latter built by King Edward I after his conquest of Wales, were just fortified barracks for royal troops. The countryside around these bastions showed no signs of a spread of English culture and remains today as Welsh in speech, feeling and lack of architectural impulse as it ever was.
<br><br>
Under the yoke of Plantagenet kings the flower of Celtic independence retreated into the vastness of the Snowdown landscape - vast mountains, notched in places like battlemented towers, with high passes and craggy peaks - from where the spirit of Welsh freedom occasionally resurfaced in the guise of her hero princes - Llwelyn the Great, Llwelyn at Gruﬂydd and Owain Glyndwr. Some part of the essence of defiance seems to linger in these wild, northern mountains to haunt this highland of rock and heather where nothing appears to have altered since the Ice Age: all is embraced by silence, save for the bleat of lambs, the sudden ﬂight of snipe, or the solitary call of the rare red kite. Here are great sweeping moorlands, rising to mountainous masses 2,000 feet or more in height and interspersed with marsh-ﬂats ablaze with golden gorse flower. Views are wide and horizons far: the wind sweeps freely across the vastness, and the skylark and meadow pipit’s song is lost to the breeze. However, soaring above all - dominating all - is the ethereal azure mass of Snowdon - the focus of bardic song and sentiment through the ages.
<br><br>
North Wales is a land composed almost entirely of ancient rock formations whose contorted form and denuded surfaces were produced by ice pressure millions of years ago.
<br><br>
In the great mass of the northern Cambrian Range, Snowdon at 3,500 feet, Carnedd
Dafydd at 3,426 feet and Carnedd Llwelynn 3,484 feet, are sister peaks - barren on their upper slopes and in winter snow covered - their summits reflected in lonely blue and black lakes of crystal purity set high up in their mountain folds. South and East of Snowdon, on the 2,000 feet contour, are the Arenig moorlands, the Berwyn Mountains and the Harlech Dome. These, in turn, are skirted by a rolling landscape intersected by moor and patches of peat-mire, which are almost intimidating in their sense of splendid immunity from traces of human activity - all, that is, except, for an occasional ruined stone and slate cottage, the long deserted shelter of shepherds seeking the high summer pastures.
<br><br>
The central plateau melts into Mid-Wales, and the Plynlimon group whose characteristics are rounded grassy shapes, worn into innumerable furrows, culminating in one very deﬁnite mountain – Plynlimon. Although in height it only rises 2,465 feet, there is something very grand and distinctive about it. Plynimon represents the comer stone of all three provinces of Medieval Wales, and also, in the peat bogs of its slopes, gives birth to both the Severn and the Wye.
<br><br>
Further south along the Cambrian backbone of Wales, lie the contorted hills, tall shadowy rock gorges and great cascades of foaming water that form the Brecon Beacons. They rise to 2,905 feet at Pen y Fan and are named from their use as sites for signal ﬁres. The wind-lashed summits have a dragon like outline, sporting sheer precipices which fall 600 feet and have been likened to the crests of giant waves about to break into the deep valley gorges or “cwns” below. On either side of the Beacons are the East and West Black Mountains. They have very distinctive individualities, and it is unfortunate and confusing that they should share a similar name - even the colour is wrong, for they are composed of outcrops of red Devonian sandstone. The Eastern group - marking the end of Wales, and the beginning of England - are imposing whale-backed barriers holding a series of long valleys, all ‘blind’ at the northern end. In one of these cwns is situated the beautiful, lonely ruin of Llanthony Abbey, whose monks deserted it as early as the 12th century. It was abandoned
during the lawless reign of Stephen, yet to stand on its site and feel the mountains enclosing around, one wonders if it was not the overpowering nature of the savage scenery that overawed the brethren rather than the turmoil of marcher wars.

<h2 id="section7">THE JARVIS FAMILY - Edward and Jane</h2>

<h3>The Jarvis family in Denbigh, Clywd,Wales, U.K.</h3>

<p>
Denbigh is an important market town pleasantly situated in the center of the Vale of Clywd, 17 klms from Rhyl and 60 klms from Chester. It was granted by Edward I to the Earl of Lindon who built a wall around the town and commenced building a castle in the year 1252.
<br><br>
The ruins of Denbigh Castle(AM) are a reminder of the particularly fierce resistance which successive English rulers met in these parts of Wales. The boundary of the castle is still marked by high walls and 8 towers, most of them ruined though the entrance gatehouse and the adjoining tower are still standing. The ancient market town itself was originally walled but after being burnt down twice in the 15th century, it was rebuilt outside the walls. The town’s landmark is the 16th century ruin known as Leicester’s Folly (<b>AM</b>), meant to be a cathedral but never completed.
<br><br>
North of the town is Plas Clough built more than three centuries ago by Sir Richard Clough who assisted Sir Thomas Greshamto establish the Royal Exchange. An English family named Clough lived in Denbigh in the 16th and 17th centuries and became patrons of bards. Reference to them in bardic verse are as "Clugh" <b>(2)</b>.
<br><br>

<b>COINCIDENCE</b>
<br><br>
Whilst researching the "ROBSON" family history I found they were descended from a Hugh Clough who had been the High Sherrif of Denbigh in the 1600's.
<br><br>
There is no known relationship between this family and the Jarvis "Clan", however both families did live in the same area albeit many years apart.
<br><br>
Some 300 years later and 19,000 klms away in another country Kathleen Robson married Leslie Douglas Jarvis.
<br><br>
The Clough family history from the 16th to the 20th century is on the following page.

(<b>3</b>) MONMOUTH, Powys - At the place which is now called Monmouth, the Romans established a military base called Blestium. Several centuries later, the Normans built a castle, which was eventually destroyed during the Civil War, and Monmouth Bridge, is a fascinating survival, the only Norman fortified bridge remaining in Britain. Its 13th century tower formed one of the four medieval gates to the town. The castle was the birthplace of the future Henry V. A statue on the 18th century Shire Hall serves as a reminder. Monmouth's second most famous son was born in 1877, C.S. Rolls, who is one half of the famous partnership of Rolls-Royce. Places of interest include the Naval Temple on Kymin Hill, a pantheon to a galaxy of admirals and naval heroes.

<h2 id="section8">THE WAY IT WAS</h2>

<p>
Imagine arriving at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide">Port Adelaide</a> in the 1840's. a small port some 15 klms from the city of Adelaide, after the overcrowded and well developed towns and ports in England. The long journey from the port to Adelaide with a horse and dray, along with all their possessions and no home to go to. I wonder what went through their minds - was it joy and anticipation for a new and better life after a long and hazardous sea voyage, or were they frightened and apprehensive about the struggle ahead to establish themselves — perhaps a little of both.
<br><br>
Adelaide was a small settlement and labour was in high demand to help build a city and to establish nearby homes and farms. Land was available to buy or lease, if you had the money to do so. Most of the early homes of settlers were very simple, built of bark or slab and mud, many consisting of one or two rooms, usually the family kitchen was a separate lean-to room, with dirt floors. If they had an underground cellar to help keep food cool and away from dust and flies, they were regarded as "wealthy".
<br><br>
People grew vegetables, planted fruit trees, kept fowls and, if they were lucky, a cow. Any extra produce they had, the women would walk miles to the nearest market to exchange their eggs and butter for groceries. Fresh meat was a rarity and included in their diet were rabbits, kangaroos and wild game. Women made clothing for the whole family, sewing by hand, out of any material available. calico bags which had contained sugar or flour were used. Excess dripping was made into soap.
<br><br>
Kerosene was used extensively and the wooden packing cases which had contained the tins were stacked on top of one another and used for storage. The tins themselves, were re-used to make buckets and when flattened out were used to line shed walls and roofs. Water was always scarce: washing water was re-used to water the garden, baths were taken once a week, usually all using the same water with more hot added as needed. scrubbing wash boards were used with home—made soap for washing clothes, flat irons or hot coal irons for ironing.
<br><br>
Men worked hard using primitive methods and few tools. Dams were dug by hand with shovels, the dirt carried out in buckets; scrub was cleared with axes, bullocks or horses were used and had to be fed and watered every day. A journey of a few miles could take a long time, therefore men were often away overnight.
<br><br>
Doctors and hospitals were few and far between, child birth often resulted in the death of both mother and child leaving the family to fend for themselves. Home remedies were used and relied on to cure all sorts of ailments.
<br><br>
Things gradually improved, cool safes were introduced in the homes, ice chests and finally refrigerators. wood stoves graduated to gas and electric stoves, washing machines were used instead of wash troughs and a copper, instead of rows and rows of clothes lines the Hills hoist rotary clothes line came into use.
<br><br>
Houses improved over the years, lino and carpets on the floors, vacuum cleaners to help clean, heaters replaced the wood fires, and fans helped in the summer heat. l-land pushed lawn mowers were replaced by motor mowers, horse trams by electric trams and trains and today the motor car is the ultimate mode of transport.

<h2 id="section9">THE JARVIS FAMILY IN AUSTRALIA - JOSHUA and MARY ANN BARRETT</h2>

<h3>JOSHUA</h3>
<p>
On the 10th June, 1851 the sailing ship "Reliance" sailed from Plymouth, in the United Kingdom with 392 immigrants bound for South Australia some 19,000 klms. It arrived at Port Adelaide on the 19th September 1851.
<br><br>
Notes on the voyage written by the Rev. W. Gray to the Archivist in Adelaide, dated 5th March, 1934 are as follows:
<br><br>
Three months, with nothing but water around them, living on pickled pork, salt junk, bouilli soup, and a cupful of pure Jamaican lime juice, (sweetened with black sugar to prevent skurvy), once a week. They went too far south. Icy tangles half a yard long hung from the shrouds, the bulwarks were frozen till they were like solid wire. Some of the passengers who had too little clothing had to go to bed to keep warm. The passengers were called up to help crew set sails to “bout ship”.
<br><br>
On board was a 19 year old young man with the name of Joshua Jarvis travelling unaccompanied.
<br><br>
On board was a family of Barretts' who were rumoured to be distant relatives to Joshua. It was the family of George Barrett, however Mary Ann's name did not appear on the manifest. I have yet to prove that these Barrett's are our family ancestors.
On the 20th January, 1855 at St. Stephens Church of England at Willunga, Joshua now aged 22, married Mary Ann Barrett aged 16 years. Joshua signed his name and Mary Ann made her mark (X). The name of the officiating Minister was Arthur Bernard Burnett and two witnesses were George Barrett and Emma Risenborough.
<br><br>
The name of the parents of both Joshua and Mary Ann were not recorded which is unusual as Mary Ann was not of legal age – therefore needing permission of her father. It is interesting to note that George Barrett and Emma Risenborough married on 18th August, 1859 at the home of his father John Barrett at Inman Valley.
<br><br>
Residences for Joshua and Mary Ann Jarvis have been listed to include : Encounter Bay, Victor Harbor, Inman Valley, Bald Hills, Claire, and Jamestown. His occupation was listed as farmer, religion Church of England.
<br><br>
Joshua and Mary Ann had the following children:
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b 25 Aug 1858 Enc Bay		d 1917 Meningie
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walter&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b 4 Jan 1877 Jamestown		d 11 Nov 1969 Victor Harbor
<br><br>
* Registered in the revised listing of births in SA as follows:
<br><br>
JARVIS AMANDA - father Joshua Jarvis, Mother Mary Ann Barrett - born 9 Jan 1867 Dist. Yank. Book 51 page 14. Also recorded is a child for Jarvis name not recorded.
<br>
Father not recorded. Mother Mary Ann Jarvis – child still born.
<br><br>
About 1880 or earlier there was a large migration chiefly to Yorke Peninsula and the north of the state from the Victor Harbor area, as the soil proved too poor for successful farming and much of the land had been cleared. I believe that Joshua and Mary moved north in search of better working conditions. Records show that Joshua worked in the Jamestown area as a builder. The National Trust records held at Jamestown (July 1993) show the Sands and McDougall's Directory lists for the area began in 1884. The name of Jarvis does not appear on Electoral roll lists prior to that.
<br><br>
Jamestown today is the centre of a productive agricultural and pastoral district. The first pastoral lease was issued in July 1851, the area opening up for farming in 1870 ending the era for the pastoralists and the town itself was surveyed in 1871, when the first land was sold to farmers who moved in to settle the area.
<br><br>
Jamestown was named after Sir James Ferguson, the then Governor of S.A., who came from County Ayr, Scotland. As a consequence many of the streets have names of Scottish origin. Some interesting facts about the town and district :
<br><br>
8 km south of Jamestown, in the Bundaleer Forest Reserve was the site of the first forest planted by a Government in Australia in 1876. The practice of raising young trees in bamboo tubes began at Bundaleer forest leading to the present day use of small plastic tubes.
<br><br>
Jamestown was the birthplace of the S.A. Farmers Union, being formed in 1888, at a meeting called by a group or local farmers who were concerned about the rising costs of corn sacks. The headquarters were later transferred to Adelaide in 1895.
<br><br>
M.S. McLeod, a descendant of a pioneering family, commenced business in Jamestown with the purchase of a cycle shop in 1916. This developed into a tyre and hardware business with stores throughout S.A. and interstate.
<br><br>
The "Emu" factory opened by the Humphris family in 1878 produced sauce, pickels butter, cordials etc.. In 1899 a branch was opened in Carrington Street, Adelaide, in a building still standing today (1995). The original building at Jamestown was demolished in 1975 to make way for the building of "Belalie Lodge".
<br><br>
The community was first served by a Cottage Hospital after which a new hospital building of four rooms for six patients (male only) was opened in 1884. This building is still part of the present hospital complex. (it was here that Joshua was taken after his accidental death).
<br><br>
It was at Jamestown in January of 1877 that Walter Jarvis was born – the youngest child of Joshua and Mary Ann. In August of that same year Joshua met with an accident which ended his life. Poor Mary Ann would only have been 38 years old. A long way from her family, a new baby and other children to care for. Welfare was unheard of except in destitute circumstances. One wonders how she managed to return to her family and what hardships she would have encountered. The ages of the children would have ranged from 19 years to 7 months. Maybe the older children had not accompanied their parents to Jamestown, preferring instead to stay in the Victor Harbor area.
<br><br>
Joshua met with a road accident. He was thrown from a cart, hitting his head and died from the injuries on the 19th August, 1877. An inquest was held on the 20th August, 1877 in Jamestown. He was 45 years old and is buried in the Jamestown cemetery in an unmarked grave. From the Jamestown burial register, 86th entry, - grave no. 31, block B, row P. No one paid for the lease of the grave. There is no headstone.
<br><br>
There appeared in the S.A. Police Gazette, a small article, on August 22nd 1877, page 139: 
<br><br>
INQUEST. On the 20th Instant, by Albert Trilling, J.P. At James Town, on the body of Joshua Jarvis, who was killed by being thrown out of his cart. Verdict - Accidental death. 
<br><br>
Information received form Eunice Jarvis (wife of Reginald Lancelot Jarvis) is that Joshua was somewhat inebriated when he fell off a load of wood and was killed. This was not stated in the police report!
<br><br>
The District Records in the Clare district which includes Jamestown holds a certificate for Joshua Jarvis. (This was not available at the Registrar in Adelaide when I previously applied.) The details were :
<br><br>
19th August, 1877 Joshua Jarvis, aged 45 years, killed by a fall. Profession labourer and teamster of Jamestown. He died in Belalie, which is on the railway line between Jamestown and Peterborough.
<br><br>
The assistant registrar who signed the certificate was Edmund John Eyre.
<br><br>
As there are no listings held for Jarvis at the National Trust at Jamestown, it is assumed that they were possibly only in the area for a short time before Joshua died. His death is not registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriage Registrar in Adelaide.
<br><br>
The following entry in the "Biographical Index of S.A. 1836-1885. Vol 2" reads as follows :
<br><br>
JARVIS JOSHUA J. born c 1832 Norfolk England, died 20-08-1877, Jamestown, S.A. Arrived 1851 "Reliance" Port Adelaide, occ. Farmer, res. Encounter Bay, Clare, Jamestown. Rel. C. England. Married Mary Ann Barrett born c 1839. Children: Edith (1858-1885) : Ellen Maria May (Phillips) 1860- ) : Joshua (1862-1885) : Emma (1864- ) : Arthur (1860-1946) : Walter (1877).
<br><br>
As these entries are sometimes submitted by family members, I wrote to the S.A. Genealogy and Heraldry Society to see if I could find out where their information originated. Their reply was that the information had not been submitted by a contributor, but details had been extracted from records held, e.g. the Australian Dictionary of Biographies and various other S.A. Records. Joshua was born in Denbigh, Wales in 1836, not in 1832 in Norfolk as stated. They have omitted Edward b 1858 and Amanda b 1867 plus the actual dates of several of the children sre incorrect. (It is recognised that many entries in these books are not correct, however, it is a wonderful guide). Better and more accessible records have since become available.
</p>

<br>

<h3>MARY ANN BARRETT/JARVIS</h3>

<p>
I have yet to prove Mary Ann's parents. As her name does not appear on the inward shipping records of the family. However, this often happened – a child was listed as just that 'a child' or perhaps not mentioned at all. I believe that her parents were John and Jane Barrett who lived at Bald Hills. I still have more work to do on this side of the family. Family myth was that the Barrett family was on the same ship as Joshua Jarvis. There was a George Barrett and his family, however the name of Mary Ann did not appear.
<br><br>
After the death of Joshua, Mary Ann returned to her relatives, who lived in Bald Hills near Victor Harbor, where after discussion, it was agreed that some of the children would go to various relatives. The eldest son, Edward, heard this discussion from a nearby room and decided that this was not what he wanted to do so he left home that night. The younger boys stayed and were raised by their grandfather Barrett.
<br><br>
Mary Ann Jarvis, wife of Joshua, died in the district of Norwood – Ref. Book 372 Page 412 – on the 1 March 1913 aged 76 years. She was born in Flitcham, Norfolk, UK and had lived in the Colony (S.A.) for 66 years. She was 16 years old when she married and had 3 male children and 4 female children – 1 female having predeceased her – Cause of death was gangrene of the foot 2 months, diabetes some years. She died at home at Norwood and was buried at West Terrace Cemetery, Adelaide on 3 March, 1913 which gave her address as 76 George Street Norwood.
<br><br>
The dates of her age do not quite tie in, but are close. Her marriage certificate shows that she was 16 in 1855 whereas she may have been 18 had she been born in 1837 as stated on the death certificate. I think the children's sex is incorrect as I believe she had 4 male and 4 female children.
<br><br>
Following the above details on Mary Ann's death certificate, I wrote to the Norfolk Records office, Norwich, requesting them to check out the Parish records of Flitcham for the period 1836-1840. Their reply stated that no entry was found for the baptism of Mary Ann Barrett. Having checked the Parishes surrounding Flitcham without success I surmise that Mary Ann was born somewhere near Norfolk and the family moved to Flitcham when she was a child before the departure for Australia. Her memory was of having lived at Flitcham. 
<br><br>
The 1841 and 1851 Census in the U.K. Does not show her living with her family in the small town of Flitcham or surrounding Parishes. Details on birth, marriage and death certificates were often, quite innocently, given incorrectly. 
<br><br>
Having checked the Civil Registration in England and Wales which began in 1837 – commonly known as St. Catherine's house Index – for the birth of Mary Ann up to 1840 I have not found an entry which shows details of her birth place in Norfolk. There are many entries for a Mary Ann Barrett who was born in this period, however I am not prepared to purchase birth certificates on the off chance that one will be our relative. (Certificates can be purchased from London at a cost of $27.50 each plus GST. The main aim being to establish the name of parents and where born and baptised) None of these entries is anywhere near the county of Norfolk.
<br><br>
I have checked the district records held at the Norwood Library and they do not have any record of which house Mary Ann resided in, nor can I find any relatives living in that street.
<br><br>
The Biographical Index of S.A. Shows the following:
<br><br>
BARRETT JOHN b 1815 died 18 Aug 1905 at Inman Valley. On arrival by 1868. Occupation farmer. Residence Inman Valley. Married Jane born 1817 died 12 Jan 1894 at Bald Hills.
<br><br>
The shipping records of Barretts arriving in S.A. Before 1855 show a "John" arriving in 1848, 1847 but no Jane and no Mary Ann.
<br><br>
From information held at Goolwa Public Library records:
<br><br>
BARRETT JANE – died 6 December 1894 (Encounter Bay 612). Age 77 years, wife of John Barrett of Bald Hills, Inman Valley. Cause paralysis of the brain. Buried at Balds Hills cemetery. Undertaker Herbert Grosvenor, Port Victor.
<br><br>
BARRETT JOHN – died 15 May 1905 aged 90 years, farner of Inmand Valley. Cause senile decay and cardiac failure. Buried at Inman Valley. Informant W. Millard a friend of Inman Valley.
<br><br>
Newspaper report in the S.A. Register on 21 August 1185, page 8, col. H: Inquest on George Barrett – found dead.
<br><br>
As I mentioned on the first page of this chapter, the two witnesses to Joshua and Mary Ann's marriage were George Barrett and Emma Risenborough. I believe that George was a brother to Mary Ann. He would have been 19 years old in 1855.
<br><br>
The following information about George Barrett gained from his marriage certificate:<br>
GEORGE BARRETT 23 years old – farmer – father John Barrett – Inman Valley and EMMA RISENBOROUGH aged 19 years – father William. Held at the house of John Barrett of Inman Valley on the 16th August 1859. Witnesses were William Risenborough (father of Emma) and Esther Dorman. (Book 1 page 40).
<br><br>
Notice in the Register on 25th August 1859 – On 16 August by special licence, at the residence of John Barrett of Inman Valley, George Barrett to Emma eldest daughter of William Risenborough both of Inman Valley.
<br><br>
They had two children: James, born 27 Sept 1863 at Hog Bay, Kangaroo Island and Jully (female) born 14 Nov 1865 at Inman Valley.
<br><br>
This was a second marriage for George, marrying Esther Dormer who was a witness at his marriage.
<br><br>
The above is the nearest I can get to establishing the family of Mary Ann Barrett. It may or may not be correct. I will continue to research this branch of the family and hopefully, one day I will find the missing clue either in Australia or back in England. I must add that I have looked at the spelling of Barratt, Barritt and Barrett. Barrett appears on the marriage and death certificates. As many folks were un-educated, the details and spelling relied on whoever was recording the information and what the informant told them.

<h2 id="section10" >The County of Norfolk</h2>

<p>
No other County in England is quite like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk">Norfolk</a>. Bulging far into the North Sea and cut off from the rest of the Country by a river system that is, perhaps, even more of a cultural barrier than a physical one, it has a distinctive building style, a unique dialect, and an individual culture. It contains a greater diversity of scenery than any other lowland county.
<br><br>
The wide range of rocks and soils provides many different environments which have limited and directed man’s efforts to impose his own pattern. However the Norfolk landscape of today is largely man-made. The woodland that covered most of the county in prehistoric times has gradually given way to meadows and pastures, fields, parks, roads, homesteads, hamlets, villages and towns. The story of the development of the landscape is not simple. Norfolk is a large county containing Roman sites, approximately 700 villages, over 700 medieval churches, moats, deserted villages, and landscape parks. The county is known for trade, industry agriculture and architecture. The people are hard working, resourceful, stubbom and independent and possessed of a caustic and subtle wit with a conviction to 'to do diﬂerent is to do well'. Nfk. 94 - 104(3)
<br><br>
<b>Trades, Crafts and Professions in England.</b>
<br><br>
If agriculture, despite the difficulties, remained the economic power-house of the countryside, a wide range of crafts and trades were needed to keep that running effectively, and to promote the smooth flow of the community life. Some men concentrated on building and repairing houses, others produced clothing and boots that people wore. Others concentrated on being tradesmen - wheelwright dependent on the blacksmith to fit the metal tyres to complete his wheels for carts and wagons, the baker relied on the miller for the supplies of his flour and the brickmaker for the tiles to line his ovens. Others took on lines of business such as baker, grocer, butcher, brickmaker, postmaster, com master, coal merchant etc.
<br><br>
Amongst these craftsmen it was the blacksmith who was the key figure in the village economy, at a time when horses reigned supreme as working animals on the farm. He was employed at shoeing them but he was expected to make and repair the implements they hauled. There were only several men employed at a blacksmith's shop each a specialist for a particular job, e.g. sharpening harrows and ploughs, shoeing horses, making new tools and outside jobs such as pumps for wells. For the labourers the smiths would make and repair hoes, scythes, leaking kettles, pots and pans etc. In their capacity as farriers the smiths were also required to treat animals which fell ill, while through their skills in shoeing they could correct faults in a horse's feet. Good feet were considered the first essential for a working horse. It was not uncommon for farmers to ask for a smith’s professional opinion before making a purchase. Some of the larger landowners would employ their own smith. Almost everywhere the local men would gather for a gossip as they waited for their horses to be attended to, or merely stood around watching with fascination as the blacksmith worked with his forge.
<br><br>
Wheelwrights were equally involved and usually had their shops next to the smithy.
<br><br>
The saddler, the hurdle-maker and the carpenter were other craftsmen, the tailor who made anything from the breeches, jackets and overcoats worn by farmers to the heavy cord trousers and sleeved Waistcoats favoured by the labourers.
<br><br>
Clothes for women were made by the women themselves, if she could not make them then she would turn to a dressmaker who was to be found in most villages.
<br><br>
A third category of tradespeople were the dealers. They ranged from rabbit-skin men,
purchasing skins at cottage doors for twopence a piece to the horse and cattle dealers. Often these dealers would work part-time as labourers, or keeping a public-house. 
<br><br>
Then there were the pedlars and hawkers working mainly where there were few shops in isolated areas. In the area of Wood Norton, Norfolk, people were regularly visited by an old man driving a donkey cart, in which he brought clean silver sea sand to sell to housewives for scouring pots and doorsteps and for spreading on the brick floors.
<br><br>
Carriers played an important part collecting poultry, eggs, ﬁuit and dairy products selling to the nearest market, taking shopping orders as well as they went. People would share a ride to the nearest town market with the produce and lifestock.
<br><br>
Village shops held a great variety of stock - food, miscellany of drapery, matting, linoleum, ironmongers, candles etc. Surviving account books show the dire poverty of some of the customers who had the greatest difficulty in paying off even small costs.
<br><br>
Quarrying and mining providing clay, stone and coal were amongst the trades needed to supply the necessities needed.
<br><br>
Landowners and farmers provided the capital and the managerial abilities necessary for the running of British farming, but it was the skill of the agricultural labourers which ensured that the wheels of that industry were kept running smoothly. Equally it was they and their families who dominated the Victorian village community. These were the shepherds who worked on a semi-independent basis keeping some of their own sheep alongside those of their employer. These were later sold for profit and in that way they became almost small farmers in their own rights.
<br><br>
The labourer's role was of major importance only to a limited degree in the prosperity of farming. They had little alternatives for employment, their wages low and working hours long. The usual arrangement being from daybreak to nightfall during the winter months and from 6 am to 5 pm in the summer. For stockmen, who came early to feed their animals and return in the evening to settle them down for the night, the working day could be much longer.
<br><br>
Women and children played a part in gathering the grain, with the farmers helping to bind the corn into sheaves and the latter assisting them, or leading horses or carrying food and drink to the harvesters. The disadvantages experienced by the agricultural workers in the matter of wages and employment conditions, compared to the situation of their urban counterparts, were reinforced by housing problems.
<br><br>
Although rural areas escaped the worst health hazards of the town slums, many country cottages were poorly maintained and  The high fertility rates of the labourers contributed to the difficulty, for the large size of their families aggravated the difficulties of overcrowding. Illegitimacy too, were highest in rural counties - one in ten born in Norfolk was illegitimate. It is true that birth and illegitimacy rates did fall a little in the last years of the century but they remained well above average for the nation as a whole and country households continued to contain large numbers of children.
<br><br>
Another difficulty was the "tied" cottage system, whereby workers who lost their jobs and inevitably lost their homes as well. Described by one labourer, "There is a feeling about tied-houses that it is not your home. You do not seem able to plant fruit trees nor work any little paying hobby because you know if anything goes wrong, out you go at a month‘s notice or less".
<br><br>
Inadequate and polluted water supplies added to the grievances of the labourer who sweated in the heat of the harvest field or endured the dust of thrashing operations and the mud of the winter ploughing, often existed without the ﬁrst essential of civilized life, a plentiful water supply. Education was a low priority.
<br><br>
Often over their evening half-pints, the men would exchange anecdotes or discuss the affairs of the day, or engage in a communal sing-song passing on the tales and folk songs of the past.
<br><br>
As urban technology grew and a network of transport sprouted up, the change in the structure of communities meant many trades and craﬁs and cottage industries ensured they were no longer contributing as they had previously done. There followed an agriculture depression causing many to move from their village or town or, for the more adventurous, the obvious solution to their problem was to emigrate looking for a better life for themselves and their children.
<br><br>
<b>How did they get there?</b>
<br><br>
If they were moving to another village the journey may have been made by the farm wagon and two horses which carried their belongings. Often with children sitting on top of the furniture or space would be left at the back for them to sit. They would all help to carry the household goods outside to be packed in the wagon. In early times goods were transported by packhorse and pannier. The simple two-wheeled wain was also then in common use, the wagon being introduced in the 16th century. Their use was difficult in winter and on poor roads. Then a network of carriers increased linking every major town in England. When the Foundling Hospital in London had a policy of open admission, in the 1750s, unwanted babies were sent up to London he means of the carriers in ever increasing numbers from the most distant parts of the country. As carriage was pre-paid many a poor child did not survive the experience.
<br><br>
For the majority of people the carrier was the cheapest means of travel. These local carriers, taking passengers and goods to market towns, survived the coming of the railways and played an important part even into this century.
<br><br>
The stage coach, at first only in London, spread to country areas, however, you would pay eight shillings for a 30 mile ride: 5 pence a mile as an inside passenger or 3 pence outside, which was quiet beyond the means of the ordinary labourer. The system disappeared almost overnight with the coming of the railways.
<br><br>
In all times those who could not afford to pay a carrier or hire a horse, walked, taking nothing with them except what they could carry. They would have thought little about sleeping out at night. The network of acquaintanceship by which everybody in the country knew somebody in the local towns probably meant that they could stay with friends at least a night or two. To stay at some rough lodging house, at the end of last century, would have cost about 4 pence a night.
<br><br>
Going to work. A farm labourer thought nothing of walking two miles or more every morning and night to and from work, getting there at 6 am, earlier at harvest time. It was not unusual at certain seasons of the year for a man to get up about 4 am and do an hour‘s gardening before starting to walk to work. Early nights were not unusual! Even young children walked miles and thought little of it,
<br><br>
Children walked to school, three or four miles every morning from age seven. It couldn’t have been much fun in the rain and snow, sitting in wet clothes all day.
<br><br>
Women walked to market carrying their wares a good four miles or more. The food purchased from the proceeds would then be carried home. Children who helped considered this a great treat for although the distance might be long it was by no means a lonely journey. The chance of a liﬁ in a carrier’s wagon or a friendly neighbour's cart, seldom occurred. In bad weather the women would return "in a pitiable plight". The coming of the railway made little difference as the women could not afford the fare.
<br><br>
A farm labourer who lived at Leek in Staffordshire in the 1880s related. that once a week he would walk the six miles to Leek market with a basket containing 200 eggs on one arm and another basket with 12 lbs of butter in it on the other”. When young, he had been a carter‘s lad and helped to lead the horses walking between them when there were two often getting trodden on. He too spoke about the weather “Often my clothes were quite wet when I took them off at night and still wet when I put them on again next morning”.
<br><br>
People walked distances to attend a church service on Sunday. They mainly walked to the church to be married. The custom of the coffin being carried on the shoulders of men for funerals died out when those that could afford a horse-drawn shell-a-bier, a sort of hearse and carriage combined, was introduced.
<br><br>
Footwear. All wore thick, stout-soled boots, well studded with nails and tipped heels and toe. They often kept a lighter pair less heavily nailed for special occasions. The boots were, of necessity, frequently examined and any missing nails or tips replaced. Nearly every cottage possessed a hobbling foot for use in these repairing jobs. They also kept a grease pot for odds and ends of tallow candles which would be warmed up and used to grease boots in winter time. It was not unusual, at the back door of the cottage, to find a pair of ‘patterns’. These wooden soles with iron rings fixed under them and straps for the feet raised the wearer well out of the mud. They were slipped on and off as the housewife went in and out of her cottage. She would not go out her the backyard in the wet weather without them. The farm labourers commonly cut the feet oﬁ new stockings and wrapped their feet in pieces of white linen or other cloth, binding fresh dock leaves over any sore, that remedy being thought generally effective, especially if the leaves were renewed fairly often. Men put a thin layer of soft hay at the bottom of their boots, it acting as a sort of absorbent sock, this again being often renewed.
<br><br>
It is interesting to note that the coming of the bicycle made little difference until almost the end of the century. Eventually the excellent railway system in England overtook most of the carrying needs from town to town.

<h2 id="section21">VICTOR HARBOR - South Australia</h2>

<p>
Victor Harbor today is a holiday resort town situated on Encounter Bay some 80 klms
south of Adelaide. It has been prominent in the history of South Australia from the earliest days, having experienced periods of depression and prosperity.
<br><br>
Captain Matthew Flinders named Encounter Bay in 1802. About 17 klms south east at
Goolwa is the Murray River mouth, whilst on the north west side of Fleurieu Peninsula are steep rocky cliffs which contrast greatly with the shore towards Port Elliot where there are long sandy beaches backed by sand hills.
<br><br>
The main features at Victor Harbor are Rosetta Head, known as The Bluff and Granite
Island lying just offshore, today joined by a causeway.
<br><br>
A Captain Crozier in the ship “H.M.S. Victor” anchored off Granite Island and named the place Victor Harbor after his ship.
<br><br>
At the time of settlement in S.A. whale oil was an important product used extensively in everyday life. A whaling station was set up in 1837. The first commodity exported from S.A. was whale oil from Victor Harbor. At the end of 1837 200 tons had been exported. The business declined and by the 1870's it ceased altogether. Several shipments of whale bones were collected and sent to England for use in the pottery trade. The whaling industry had been a badly managed business that did not enhance the reputation of the district.
<br><br>
To enable people who had settled inland to move their produce to the coast quickly and cheaply, it was decided to establish a port on the South Coast to handle the trade and produce using the paddle steamers on the Murray River. Because of the unreliability of the river mouth near Goolwa, the heavy seas and rough weather suffered at nearby Port Elliot, conditions were dangerous for sailing vessels. It was decided to construct a jetty at Victor Harbor. A breakwater was built using local granite quarried from the island and the causeway extended.
<br><br>
This became the largest undertaking in S.A. up to that time. Railway type trucks running on rails were pulled by nine horses, which were stabled on the island.
<br><br>
The port was used for local and overseas cargoes as well as receiving such items as the unassembled river paddle steamer in June 1866, brought out as cargo and destined for use on the River Murray. It was assembled at Goolwa.
<br><br>
An unusual happening should be noted of the Norwegian baroque Margot.
<br><br>
She arrived in September 1911 to load wheat. During the evening she was due
to sail the Captain went ashore to see the Harbour Master about his departure. He left in a small dinghy to rejoin his ship and was never seen again. The dinghy and one oar were located but the Captain's body was never found. An Inquiry was held but no explanation of his disappearance was found. This delayed the sailing. The ship's carpenter was appointed Third Mate and the “Margot” finally departed on 10 November 1911.
<br><br>
She did not get far and went ashore on the Coorong. This was subsequently stated as due to inexperience of the Third Officer, who was on watch at the time of the mishap. Sailing too close to the shore causing the ship to run aground. All the crew reached shore safely.
<br><br>
When the news of the tragedy reached Victor Harbor, the lifeboat “Lady Daly” stationed there was prepared. The usual crew was not available at the time so local men volunteered to man the lifeboat. By the time “Lady Daly” reached the wreck, the cargo of wheat had “sprung” the timber and was giving off dangerous fumes. The baroque was beginning to break up. After completing their job at the wreck the lifeboat and crew set out to return home. Due to an offshore wind they were blown far out to sea and to the great worry of the townsfolk did not reach home for three days. But consternation soon turned to joy when the lifeboat and its crew returned safe and sound. (<i>This information was obtained from a visit to the Historical Society at Victor Harbor. Whilst there I came across a photograph of the crew on board the lifeboat. Amongst them were Arthur Jarvis and his son Keith Jarvis.</i>)
<br><br>
With the development of the harbour it soon became obvious that a lighthouse was needed. It was erected on a high tripod and operated by a kerosene light that could be seen for 8 klms. Eventually a gasoline-burning lamp replaced this in 1884. In 1955 an electric fixed light was established to act as a guide for fishing boats using the harbour.
<br><br>
Today, of course, the island is a showpiece for tourists - its role has varied from whaling station to overseas port - to tourist attraction. It has been beautified with walking pathways, seats, play areas, a ramp to the top of the cliff and many trees have been planted.
<br><br>
Originally, when used as a seaport, horse drawn trucks transported goods, later small
locomotives were used, and in 1894 a passenger service commenced using horse drawn trams. The cost was 3 pence return. At one stage a double decker tram carried up to 36 people, and a Ferguson tractor camouflaged as a train operated, pulling four locally built carriages. Today they have returned to horse drawn vehicles as a tourist attraction.
<br><br>
Victor Harbor as a town did not exist until 1863. The only substantial building was the
Police Station erected near Police Point. Several small huts had been erected on the town site. In 1863 two bridges, one over the Hindrnarsh River and the other across the Inman River, were opened. Their opening marked the beginning of organized settlement within the boundaries of the town. Before these bridges were built people had to ford the rivers, consequently the town was not visited by many people.
<br><br>
The first stone house was built on the site of the present Hotel Victor, and became the site for the present modern hotel. A large railway goods shed was built in 1864 to cater for traffic on the original horse drawn railway. The telegraph station was also completed in 1864, making communications with Adelaide much easier. The Bank of S.A. opened its first branch in 1865.
<br><br>
The newspapers of the day reported that by the middle of 1864 a large number of buildings were being erected and the town was assuming important proportions. Kerosene lights originally lighted the streets. These were replaced by electric lights and electricity was connected to homes in the town. Better roads and footpaths improved the appearance of the town and added to the welfare of the people.
<br><br>
Travelling in the early days was a major undertaking. The first overland link between
Victor Harbor and Adelaide was by bullock wagon and the journey of about 82 klms
usually took three days. Cobb & Co. replaced this mode of travel with coaches. The
service operated between Port Elliot and Adelaide taking 8 hours, the price for a single fate was 14 shillings and 6 pence. The return journey took 19 hours. Cast your mind back to those travellers and imagine how they would have felt on arriving at Victor Harbor after being jolted around in coaches with hard seats, travelling over roughly formed limestone roads. One can only imagine the discomfort they experienced and understand why people in those early days only travelled when it became absolutely necessary.
<br><br>
The road to Victor Harbor was bitumenised in 1928. The same road has been rebuilt,
removing curves making it a comfortable scenic drive of 2 hours or less, compared to the then 8 hour trip in a Cobb & Co. coach.
<br><br>
This concludes the many facets of Victor Harbor, from the first shipment of whale oil, to the great days when large ships called and loaded cargoes of wheat and wool, to how the activity ceased quiet quickly due to government's centralization policies.
<br><br>
The area grew from a few rough huts into a thriving community with large buildings
worthy of any town. The character of the town has changed from a commercial aspect into a place with great tourist potential. This is the main draw card today and it is hoped it will maintain its place as premier tourist resort in South Australia.

<h2>INMAN VALLEY</h2>

<p>
The physical sets of Inman Valley. The Valley situated on Fleurieu Peninsula approximately 80 klms south of Adelaide, runs in an easterly direction from Bald Hills to Victor Harbor. The River Inman flows towards its mouth at Encounter Bay and contains water all year round.
<br><br>
The following passage from the Geology Department, University of Adelaide, briefly outlines the local geological history.
<br><br>
Approximately 270 million years ago (Permian Age) ice covered much of southern
Australia and glaciers or ice sheets moved down from the highlands smoothing off any
exposed rocks over which they passed. Such smoothed bedrock surfaces called
“pavements” are found in a number of places in the Victor Harbor area. As the climate
moderated they melted leaving a considerable volume of sediments deposited in lakes and bays behind the retreating ice. These sediments, known as “till”, consist of clay and sand and contain occasional large boulders, or “erratics”. The erractics here are composed of granite, or other basement rock types derived from this locality or from further southeast.
<br><br>
They are presumed to have been dropped from icebergs floating in the Permian waters. A spectacular example can be seen at Selwyn Rock, located at Glacier Rock Teahouse in Inman Valley. Here a large rounded erractic of granite embedded in till occurs in the creek bank adjacent to a well-expected glacial pavement. The preservation of the Permian sediments is rather remarkable considering the soft and poorly consolidated nature of the till and the fact that most of the area has been exposed to erosion of the land mass over the last several hundred million years. 
<br><br>
What is known locally as the “Coal Bore”, located in the top end of Back Valley, was
drilled to a depth of 300 meters, thought to be the floor of the glacial valley.
<br><br>
Discovery and early description. Europeans first sighted the Valley in 1831 when
Captain Collet Barker crossed the Peninsula from St. Vincent Gulf and travelled through the valley area to the Murray Mouth, where he met his death, his support party returning via the Inman Valley. The Valley was named after the first Superintendent of Police,
<br><br>
Henry Inman who was appointed by Governor Hindmarsh on April 1, 1838, His salary
was set at two hundred pounds per annum. He resigned in 1840. Henry was a son of
Professor Inman, of Portsmouth Naval College, having served as a lancer in the British
Army and described as having been tall and powerful - “bold as a lion”.
<br><br>
The first Census of South Australia was taken by Mr. Inman on 30 January 1839. He returned to England and was ordained as a minister of the Church of England.
<br><br>
Two aboriginal names for the Inman River are Moo-oola and Moogoora.
<br><br>
Mr Frome, the Surveyor General succeeding Colonel Light travelled through the Valley of the Inman in 1839 and did some drawings that are now in the S.A. Art Gallery. Governor Gawler visited the district in 1839 and his description of the valley is recorded in the S.A. Gazette as follows:
<br><br>
“Twenty five miles to the south of the Inman in Encounter Bay runs a lovely Valley,
varying from six to two miles in width, well watered and rich in soil for agriculture and
heritage for pasture. In this Valley division hills, which separate the eastward and the westward waters, are about ten miles from Yankalilla. Their summits are covered with pasture, and their height is not above 100 metres above the sea, while that of the precipitous mountains which bound the Valley to the north and south is from 400 to 620 metres.”
<br><br>
The blue haze on the Inman Hills fascinated travellers in the early years when viewed from Bald Hills and were often likened to the Blue Mountains.
<br><br>
Early settlements. Early settlement is bound up in the history of Bald Hills. The upper
portion of the Valley extends beyond Sheoak Hill and includes the heavier type soils on the hills dividing the Inman and Back Valleys all within the Bald Hills area. It is difficult to say when the first settlers arrived, about 1842. A Mr. Field leased a large area of land before land grants were made and overlanded cattle from the eastern states in 1837,
<br><br>
The early 1840's to 1850 seemed to be the period of considerable settlement. By 1850 Bald Hills was well settled, and to a lesser degree the fertile areas of the Inman Valley. The better type soils were selected for wheat growing and throughout the area furrows can still be seen where the farmers ploughed their fields - usually a portion of their 80 acre section.
<br><br>
Those early settlers had by necessity, to be self-sufficient and many of them brought with them trees and cuttings to establish their gardens. To have a horse, a fruit and vegetable garden, and a few acres enclosed with a post and rail fence was considered important progress. They found the reliable rainfall most successful for the growing of wheat, with flour in the early boom years selling at twelve pounds per bag. Yields of 30-40 bushels per acre were common from the fertile virgin soils.
<br><br>
Harvesting by hand sickle was common in the first few years. Threshing was accomplished by means of a large, ribbed and tapered log, some 6 metres long, anchored at the small end and motivated by two bullocks attached to the larger and outer end to roll over a circular area. The heads of wheat placed within this area would be crushed in preparation for hand winnowing in the wind. In this way large quantities of wheat could be threshed with a fraction of the effort needed for hand flailing. The farmers would then travel to the flour mills at Encounter Bay, with their wagons loaded with grain and pulled by teams of bullocks or later horses. The fields were ploughed with single furrow ploughs drawn by bullocks. Until horses became plentiful bullocks were the main draught animals for quite a number of years.
<br><br>
From the early records we can assume that a good number of settlers came to the Inman during the l840's. However, the surveys had not then been made and it is presumed that these settlers leased, rented or “squatted” on the land. 1850 completed the survey for the Inman Valley-Bald Hills area and by 1860 most land was taken up. A late survey of the poorer country or “wastelands” was opened up for selection in 1884. Obviously there were many other people in the area who rented or purchased land in later years.
<br><br>
Life was not easy for these early settlers who had only a limited supply of tools and
equipment which they bought with them. They often had to make do with what was
available locally. Fortunately, with the early settlers came several excellent stonemasons, who set to work immediately to build permanent and solid homes with the stone that was quarried in the nearby hills. Floors were often slabs of slate. Those who could not afford to employ builders had to set to and build a home with little more than their own hands and with whatever materials were readily to hand - clay and light timber. Many homes were built of this clay or “pug”. “Pug” or “wattle and daub” consisted of straight wattle sticks lashed or nailed together with mud or pug plastered in and around to fill up the cracks. The roof would be of thatch and the whole house would consist of only 2 or perhaps 4 rooms of low profile and often partly dug into the side of a hill. Large slabs of red gum or slate formed the rather uneven floor.
<br><br>
Aborigines. The natives of the area were the Encounter Bay tribe, and it appears that they gave little trouble and were generally ignored by the white settlers. They valued Back Valley as a hunting ground referring to it as “Pondyong” which means plenty - plenty of water and plenty of kangaroos. At daybreak the kookaburras would burst into laughter, countless bush land birds twittered and chattered, and the movement of water could be heard as it made its way down the valley.

An interesting story is told of a William Isaac Lush, who as an infant in the mid 1840's, was put out in the sun in a crib. A group of natives, accustomed to receiving gifts of tea, sugar and tobacco, called at the hut. A lubra with a piccaninny, on seeing the white baby, decided she liked it best. The swap was quickly made, and the lubra made off to the scrub with William Lush, leaving her own black baby in the crib. 
<br><br>
Fortunately Mrs. Lush, who with the valuable aid of the sheep dogs, headed off the lubra soon discovered the change, and the infants were returned to their rightful mothers. Another version of the story says that the Lushes had to go to the native camp on the beach to retrieve their child. (<i>Taken from the book titled "The story of Victor Harbor" by A.A. Strempel</i>).
<br><br>
An account given by William Joseph Barratt, oldest son of an early pioneering family, gives us an insight into life in the l800's when he wrote the following at the age of 90 years:
<br><br>
“My parents, William James and Anne (Gibson) married in 1846 and soon afterwards lived at “Glenbrook” on Lower Inman Valley. James, Anne and I were born there, and I was 4 years old when we went to live on section 306 at Back Valley, which opened on to Bald Hills. At that time, nothing had been done to the scrub. We were reared there and Mary, Prudence, Sarah and Frederick were born there. When I was 6 years old and James was 4, we had to drive a team of bullocks for father when he was ploughing. At harvest time we had to cut wheat with a sickle for reaping. We cut it up and put it in heaps and father tied it. Father afterwards bought sections 395 and 396 near Lower Inman. He couldn't grow wheat on it, so it was used for dairying and later sold. James and I rented it for three years, then I took it over for another seven years. By this time I was 30. In 1895 I finally settled at Torrens Vale.” (<i>Taken from the book titled "The Echoing Valley". A tribute to the pioneers of Back Valley near Victor Harbor. Compiled by Eric Richardson</i>).

<h2>Port Elliot - Encounter Bay</h2>

<p>
It is quite possible that the area near the Murray River mouth and the coast westward to Port Elliot was known to the sealers who lived on Kangaroo Island as early as 1828.
However, the first recorded instance of white men on this part of the South Australian
coast was in February 1830 when Captain Sturt and his party reached the sea after their trip down the Murrumbidgee and Murray rivers in a whale boat. It must be noted that they only saw this coastline from the sea, not being aware of the large river mouth's existence. Sturt reported a “disappointing outlet to the sea”.
<br><br>
Goolwa was chosen as the river port terminal, handling the wheat, barley and wool trade from the paddle steamers on the Murray. After a great deal of deliberation a railway line was built between Goolwa and Port Elliot which was considered to be the best place for a seaport. This consisted of 6 miles of track being laid and was officially opened in May 1854. The average speed of all trips was about 7 m.p.h.
<br><br>
Once the line was functioning, more people moved into the locality and the scrub around the area was cleared. The land yielded good crops, the growing river trade created more work and this in turn attracted more people to Port Elliot.
<br><br>
Settlers arrived, having moved south from Adelaide, selected land along the foothills,
buildings were erected in scattered locations, and a road from Goolwa to Victor Harbor
formed.
<br><br>
The stone walls of the Congregational Church comprised the first substantial building in the town, on Montpelier Terrace, remaining unfinished until 1853 when a thatch roof was added and the church completed. In 1852 the Port Elliot Hotel was built on the main road, with a large assembly hall used by the townspeople. Extensive stables as well as yards for bullock wagons were provided. Also in 1852 the obelisk on Freeman Nob was erected as a guide for shipping, a point which helped the Sealers on Kangaroo Island. Nearby the Harbormaster's Cottage was built and used for the first postal services in the town.
<br><br>
Fresh water was a problem, especially as ships coming into the port needed to replenish their supplies. At a point about one mile inland there were several natural springs providing good quality water. A site was selected to build a tank as a source of supply, pipes eventually laid and water was used for shipping and also for townspeople, using a hand pump. This method was used until the l870's when the pipes corroded. Eventually the town was connected to the main supply for the whole of the South Coast.
<br><br>
A Police Station was erected, stables for the police horses, a store, a flour mill, guest house and the Southern Argus newspaper was first produced in March 1866. In 1868 the newspaper was sold and the printing works transferred to Strathalbyn. A new post office was built a Court House and the first public school in the town was opened in 1857.
<br><br>
Up to this time the development of the town had been dramatic but then the pace slowed because the port had not proved suitable and the shipping disaster of 1865 sealed its fate.
<br><br>
This and other tragedies brought about the transfer of the port facilities to Victor Harbor. Serious bush fires devastated large areas in the summer of 1859 resulting in a further setback.
<br><br>
In 1861 it was proposed to extend the railway line to Victor Harbor and eventually a new railway station was built. A coach was now running from Adelaide by Cobb & Co., the journey costing 14 shillings and 6 pence one way and took 8 hours to complete.
<br><br>
Port Elliot grew and with the transfer of shipping to Victor Harbor adopted the role of
tourist town. The town has experienced affluent times as well as disappointments and
people not only supported their immediate area but the whole of the South Coast.
<br><br>
The town began in 1852 and developed at a rapid rate until 1864 when the port was moved. Development then slowed and the tourist development has continued successfully to this day.
<br><br>
The South Coast and Fleurieu Peninsula has played an important part in the history of
South Australia with vital contribution being made in helping to develop the inland towns along the River Murray.

Excerpts from the book THEY WERE TRIMMERS - Victor Harbor in the 1900s.
Memoirs of Walter Buxton Bruce, retold by Anthony Laube. Gillingham Press, Adelaide. ISBN 0 646 12648 2. Walter Bruce 1898 - 1989.
<br><br>
Walter Bruce was born in the back bedroom of his Granny's house in Burke Street, Victor Harbor. His mother was Annie (Buxton) and his father William James Bruce. 
<br><br>
When he finished school my Granny arranged for him to learn butchering from Mr.
Field. Eventually, he drove the butchers' cart for Birds' up to the Bay and all over Victor Harbor, selling meat. The cart had two wheels was all painted with a chrome rail around the top. The inside was duluxed white and had vents, and hooks to hang the meat on. He would cut what was wanted as he went. Walter often accompanied his father on the cart. He earned about 30/- a week.
<br><br>
Walter Bruce's life spanned almost a century which has seen violent changes in society and the horrors of war on a scale unimaginable at the close of the l800's. He and the people of Victor Harbor retained a sense of community that was forthright and realistic, ever tolerant of the “trimmers” in there midst.
<br><br>
<b>SCHOOL</b>
<br><br>
About 1905 a Nellie Jackman taught us in the junior class, on the comer of the old stone building. There was just one building in those days. There was another room at the back, of the little room where children were taught.
<br><br>
Stan Hyde, Darcy Honeyman and the JARVIS BOYS were all in the junior class with me and the Bradley girls. A teacher Miss Isobel Christian White was from Goolwa. She was very clever, she was a Bachelor of Arts, having studied arts and crafts at the University and music at the Conservatorium in Adelaide. She was tall with auburn hair and she always wore pleated serge skirts - cream for summer and navy for the winter. She was very kind and always went to a lot of trouble for concerts and musicals, even buying materials for costumes out of her own pocket for the poorer ones. After school she was always willing to help with our homework and when any of the children were sick she would visit and take them fruit. She could paint and draw. She played the piano for singing (we all bought a shilling to pay for the cost of the piano.) It cost about 20 pounds. We loved to sing.
<br><br>
<i>
“The word “trimmer” - its derivation as a colloquial term is uncertain, though in Victorian England, a certain Mrs. Trimmer was a writer of sternly, moralistic, children's stories. Later, in Colonial Australia, the term was applied to the police troopers. However, our grandparents used the term to refer to anyone who was a “character” or, at worse, anyone of bad character. The favour of the times or the idiosyncrasies of the characters involved.
</i>
<br><br>
The big room at the front of the school was in tiers, so that you could see the blackboard above the head of the person in front. It was just painted on the wall. 
<br><br>
Another time when we returned from holidays there was a green painted blackboard nailed to the wall. We had four terms in those days.
<br><br>
There was a room on the end of the school where the girls were taught domestic arts, they had a stove to do the cooking on. The girls also learnt sewing and they were taught on a sewing machine a “Busy Bee”.
<br><br>
We marched into school to the tune of “Men of Harlech” played by a teacher. We always sang the National Anthem “God Save the Queen”. Singing was taught on Friday
afternoons.
<br><br>
We played knucklebones, cricket, football, marbles, skipping.
<br><br>
On Arbor Day we planted trees at Grosvenor Gardens. Circuses were held there. Children were asked to write a composition after their holidays and the following was written by Walter Bruce:
<br><br>

Victor Harbor, 8th Oct. 1912
<br><br>
<i>
Dear teacher,
<br><br>
We had our school holidays last week. We broke up for the holidays on visiting day. on the Saturday there was a football match. The Mallala and Victor Harbor footballers. The Mallala foot ballers drove to Victor Harbor in eight large motor cars. It was a very exciting game. some of the children spent their holidays in town. During the holidays I
went to the beach and gathered shells. I watched some ladies playing tennis. In the afternoon I went out in the scrub, and got a nice bunch of wild flowers. I went over to the breakwater and watched the large breakers. During the holidays we had a few wet days. I went for a walk up to the Hindmarsh Bridge, and watched some men fishing. I spent my holidays very enjoyable.
<br><br>
I am,
<br>
Your obedient pupil
<br>
Walter.
</i>
<br><br>
The inspector used to come and gave tests, then gave the children a half holiday
afterwards. The boys used to say, “Come again next Friday, Mr Goode, and give us
another half-holiday”.
<br><br>
On Empire Day, Mrs Cudmore from “Adair” always gave us six footballs for the boys and a dozen skipping ropes for the girls. She was a very nice person.
<br><br>
Cadets were on alternate Fridays. We were called up once a fortnight from two until four. It was compulsory to attend. Our guns were kept in the old Wesleyan Church. We had to drill there - where Lindsay Street is now. The rifle butts were kept out at Mr. Welch's place at Hindmarsh Valley. When it was wet we had to clean the rifles and if anyone purposefully missed practice they were sent to Largs Bay to clean the rifles for a week.
<br><br>
You joined the year you turned fourteen, that was compulsory, and went until you turned eighteen. A colonel Malpas was in charge of the boys at first. He was well-liked and quite lenient with them. He was from Willunga. The hats they wore were turned up at the sides with a number in front. They wore puttees. (Material used to secure trouser legs to boots. Protection from sticks and snakes etc.). They were a nuisance - you had to wind them round and round your legs.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>BURKE STREET</b>
<br><br>
I remember a time when it was all paddocks from St. Augustine's hall up to the corner. All the blocks between there and Crozier Street were empty the land belonging to the Lindsays.
<br><br>
The house belonging to Granny Bruce was built in 1911 Lawsons had the block next door and they had a small iron house. It was just two rooms, a kitchen and bedroom. The Jarvis' lived there at one time. Mr. Arthur Jarvis and his family. Little Mrs. Jarvis had a hard time of it. They had a big table in the kitchen which they would push right up in the comer by the window, and the two older boys slept on that. Les Jarvis, the youngest, was born in the bedroom, I think. Harold Jarvis married Belle I remember swimming in the mouth of the Hindmarsh River. There was a swing bridge .
<br><br>
There would be Darc Honeyman, Harold and Keith Jarvis and the Hyde boys. We'd wait until some of the girls were halfway across and we'd make it swing. The girls would scream! Later in 1910 it was carried away in a flood. They played football in Hays paddock where Gantley Avenue now is. The boys would climb the olive trees and belt Belle Inglis with olives - she was always barracking the players.  Photo of team on page 82 Keith Jarvis. (Photo of swing bridge page 48).
<br><br>
<b>NEW YEARS DAY</b>
<br><br>
Was always a big thing at Victor. There'd be two tram cars to the Island, both full. It was murder to walk on the jetty. The organizers would get up at five o'clock to decorate the causeway, tacking flags all along it. There'd be people all over the rocks and a seat was hard to find. They had a flagpole right on top of the Island with flags on it. Games used to be held on the Working Jetty. That's long gone. There was the old greasy pole with a feather stuck on the end of it. Very few men were able to get to the end and get the feather. There were prizes for that.
<br><br>
The Yacht races on New Year's Day used to look lovely, all out there on the sea. The
Rumblelows, the Williams, Jarvis's and Jeffreys, they all had yachts. 
<br><br>
Lasso, I think his name was, had a stall selling cool drinks and fr11it. This was just a piece of canvas on poles. There would also be a beer stall.
<br><br>
<b>THE ISLAND</b>
<br><br>
There used to be a little chuffing steam engine to take wheat across to the ships. The
cockle-train went right across to the Screwpile Jetty with wool. On the end of the breakwater there was a light. It was a tripod structure with an iron ladder. But the sea air and the water washing over it all the time corroded it. Mr. Jeffreys used to climb the iron ladder to light the lamp. All the old pieces of machinery that were used to build the breakwater were left lying around Granite Island - where they had been left.
<br><br>
Before the war, (World War 1) the military used to camp on Granite Island, above the
cliffs. They had a cannon and they would post warnings to the fishermen before they fired at Seal Rock for practice.
<br><br>
The lifeboat shed was at the end of the causeway. They would fire a line to the ship, then secure the rope and bring the people to shore along it, in the breeches-buoy. The lifeboat was cork, with twelve oars. I remember the wreck of the Margot down on the Coorong in 1911. I remember the rocket being fired. There was Harry Battye, Joe Joy, the Williams and the Jarvis boys - all went out to her. They put the crew ashore to walk back along the beach, but it took three days for the lifeboat crew to get back, the wind kept blowing them away from the land, I remember Harry Battye said they thought they'd never see home again. Later two men died trying to salvage the cargo of wheat. It gave off poisonous fumes and they were overcome by it.
<br><br>
<b>OLD FOLKS</b>
<br><br>
The Lindsays owned all the land around where Lindsay Street is today. They gave land for the Church of England and the remaining blocks were sold off to working men.
<br><br>
Old Mrs. Lindsay used to go out in her hooded buggy with a big white dust coat on, like the men used to wear, and one of those pith helmets, like they wear in India. But on Sunday she would be nicely dressed in dark clothes to go to church, down here at St. Augustine's. 
<br><br>
The Jarvis boys used to live near their gate, up in Crozier Road and would open it for Mrs. Lindsay and she'd give them sixpence. Later on, they had a contraption where she could drive over a bump in the road with the wheel and it made a chain pull the gate open. After she went through, she drove over another bump and it pulled the gate shut. They kept cows in the paddock.
<br><br>
<b>THE WAR</b>
<br><br>
When the war started old Tommy Nevin got up and told all the boys they should go. Some said they weren't going to go. I remember one of them saying he would rather be a coward than a dead hero. All those boys dying, I hope there'll never be another war.
<br><br>
There were a lot of “send-offs” and “welcome homes” during the war. They would have a concert with a dance to follow in the town hall. A lot of them didn't come home.
<br><br>
Claude Clark, the dentist's son went and Lance Cakebread and the Jarvis boys. They all came back except Keith Jarvis, the eldest (Keith Jarvis died and a tree is planted in his memory). He didn't come back and he was engaged to be married too. Of course there were those who said their boys weren't going to go. You can't blame people, when they have children and bring them up and then there's a war comes along, not wanting them to go. The boys weren't the same when they came back, there was always something. Jack Bruce was the first to be killed. He was a fine big handsome boy over six foot tall.
<br><br>
Before the Soldiers' Gardens were started by Bert Warland down on the sea front, they tried planting trees on the side of the Bluff. The trees never did very well there so they decided to put the gardens down on the seashore. They used to be beautiful once, full of flowers.
<br><br>
<b>FIRE</b>
<br><br>
There was a fire at Mount Breckan. The children were at school and it was just after 2
o'clock - the train had just gone through - It was Feb 25, 1909. Folks in the town
downed tools and went to help to fight the fire. The flames were lapping around the
windows and then crack the glass would fall in. The roof was slate with sheets of lead
capping on the comers. As it got hot the lead melted, the slates slipped and you could see the roof beams all red hot and bit by bit they dropped down inside.
<br><br>
A plumber, down from Adelaide, had been working on a leaking tank in the ceiling that
supplied water to the bathrooms. He took a lantern with a candle in it up into the roof , the kind that a door slides up. They should have had more sense and that is how it started.
<br><br>
The gardener was raking leaves when he saw a wisp of smoke coming from one of the
vents in the gables. When he went to look the roof was full of flames. They saved most of the furniture from downstairs, It was all over in an hour but it kept smoldering all night.
<br><br>
The Hays went back to Adelaide, then a few months later Mrs. Hay and her daughter were lost at sea on the Waratah, on their way back to England. The Waratah disappeared on its' way to Cape Town and never heard of again.
<br><br>
Vandals smashed the eagles on the steps of Mount Breckan and wrote all over the walls. A couple of the gables fell in as well as the ornamental carving on the tower. It would have fallen down eventually if Mr. Connell had not bought it and had it rebuilt. 
<br><br>
There was an old peacock left up there, strutting around amongst the ruins. You would often see him but couldn't get close before he flew off.
<br><br>
The old Post Offïce was in Coral Street. The first window (on the north end) was the
letter window, where you asked for your mail. The foundation is worn there from people resting their feet on it. A verandah ran right along. The old station master's cottage was in the alleyway behind the post office. They pulled it down in 1903 to extend the station. The original station building was weather board. It became full of white ants and dry rot. The turntable was where the railway station garden is now. It took two men to turn the turntable. Later it was moved up to Eyre Terrace. The Police Station was on the Crown Reserve (Warland Reserve). Walter worked as a station hand for a short while. His first job each morning was to sweep the office. He used to clip the tickets and sweep out the carriages when the 12 o'clock train came down. The porters came down with the train from the city and were supposed to help with the baggage. but they were down the road at the pub. He had to glue labels on the luggage with the old glue-pot. He didn't like working at the station so didn't stay long.
<br><br>
There are still a couple of trees near the road which were in the front garden of the police station. On the sea front were the wool stores. The Austral was the best hotel in town. All the toffs stayed there. The Aborigines were down in the Soldiers Gardens - they had their humpies there) They were often given the “left overs” from the dining room. There were other hotels - The Crown, Hotel Victor and many boarding or guest houses had opened up for people holidaying mainly from Adelaide.
<br><br>
Many of the affluent families had a house in the city and their “summer house” at Victor Harbor. This was so of the families who lived at Mount Breckan - the Hays - at Adair the Cudmores. These such places employed many of the local people.
<br><br>
<b>EIGHT HOURS DAY</b>
<br><br>
8 hours day was always a big thing at Victor Harbor in those days, There would be a
march with races afterwards on the reserve next to the old police station. The children
would race down to the cell walls and back again. The prize being a bag of lollies
<br><br>
<b>ABORIGINES</b>
<br><br>
We'll never know how some of them lived, the old Aborigines. Some of our men used to chase after the women. They should have had more respect for their wives and left them alone. They used to camp in the sand hills, before that they camped where the Soldiers Gardens are. There were six to a dozen of them and their families in tents and humpies. Then they moved to the point at the mouth of the Inman River The government put three weather board houses on the Inman banks for them. They held Corroborees on the Crown Reserve in the early 1900's, dancing and clapping their hands and singing.
<br><br>
Poor old things they paddled about in their bare feet summer and winter, no wonder so many of them died. Some of them contracted tuberculosis. Each week they went down to the police station to collect their rations from the government. People were kind to them, giving them cups of tea and something to eat.
<br><br>
One lady working in her front garden - behind a hedge - heard one of them say “We'll go in here but we probably won't get much, they're mean buggers”. Sometimes you'd see the men in the sand hills, they'd get a bottle or a white man would buy them one. They were not allowed to have alcohol in those days.
<br><br>
They were hard workers and worked for the Corporation around the town. Some were 
employed by the larger households whilst many taught the local children to swim. They collected rushes from Goolwa and made beautiful round rush mats and baskets with lids.
<br><br>
They went to school with the local children and were good scholars. The boys were good footballers and cricketers. Many children were educated at Point MacLeay Mission.
<br><br>
Harry Butler flew his plane and landed at Mount Breckan on the golf course by the river. That was New Year's Day 1920. In 1921 someone landed a plane on Granite Island. The pilot gave rides for 10/- as a fund raiser.
<br><br>
The Depression saw hard times with so many people out of work. If you didn't work you starved - it is all so different now.
<br><br>
During World War II the RAAF took over Mount Breckan. The foot bridge was opened
on the Inman River in 1937.
<br><br>
The Bruces' houses in Burke Street were demolished in 1990 as they were badly in need of repair. Two stately homes were built for wealthy families from Adelaide and are still there today.
<br><br>
Mount Breckan was built by a canny Scot, Alexander Hay who emigrated to South
Australia in 1839. He was successful in business and in land dealings. He became the
Honourable Hay after gaining a seat in the first House of Assembly of S.A. in 1857. 
<br><br>
They had a magnificent home in Linden Park, Adelaide. His second wife suggested that they build a small seaside cottage on the hill at Victor Harbor. In 1880 making a grand gesture he erected Mount Breckan, a stately mansion of twenty-two rooms with an eighty-foot tower. It was designed by a Scottish architect, cost 10,000 pounds to build, and was set in a well-wooded estate overlooking the harbour and the Hindmarsh River. 
<br><br>
After the house was completely burnt out by fire in 1909, Mrs Hay and her daughter boarded the “Waratah” for a holiday in Europe. All went well until they left Durban after which they were never heard of again. It was presumed that she was top heavy and turned over.
<br><br>
Mount Breckan was rebuilt as an exclusive guest house with a nine hole golf course. Much of the land was sold off in large parcels and homes with breath-taking views were built.
<br><br>
In the Second World War Mount Breckan was acquired by the R. A. A.F. for the training of air crews, and afterwards it was used as a Rehabilitation Centre. In 1960 the building was purchased by the Adelaide Bible Institute. Today over 100 theological students from all States and overseas prepare for diplomas and degrees in divinity at Mount Breckan.
<br><br>
Adair looked like a fairy castle The house was built by the Cudmores. They owned
“Avoca Station” and a house in the city. Adair was their summer house. They had
gaslights that could be raised or lowered by weights, before that they had kerosene lamps on stands. The spires on the turrets were eight feet tall.

<h2 id="section22">ARTHUR HAROLD 'PA' JARVIS and ELIZA</h2>

<p>
Arthur was born on 20 November 1868 at Inman Valley. Listing in the “Biographical
Index of S.A. 1835 - 1885” reads as follows:
<br><br>
JARVIS ARTHUR B 1868 parents Joshua and Mary Ann nee Barratt. Occ: Policeman, labourer. carpenter, fisherman. res: Gawler, Mt. Gambier, Victor Harbor.<br>
mar: Eliza Jane nee James b 1868* Balaklava S.A. children <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keith (1891 – 1916) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harold (1894-1956) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric Roy (1896 – 1967) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reginald (1899 – 1983) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leslie Douglas (1904 – 1984) <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marjorie Alice Edith (1909 – 1993). <br>
* (Note Eliza's birth date should be 1867) <br>
<br><br>
After the death of his father Joshua, the family returned to the Inman Valley area where Arthur and Walter were brought up by their grandfather Barrett, known as “Old Grump”.
<br><br>
It is recorded that these two brothers cut timber for firewood delivering and selling it in Victor Harbor. They cut hubs from timber for wagon wheels. (<i>Reference: “The Echoing Valley” page 22. A tribute to the pioneers of Back Valley compiled by Eric Richardson, Victor Harbor</i>).
<br><br>
On 1 October 1889 Arthur joined the S.A. Police Force as a 3/C Foot Constable then became a 2/C and moved to Mount Gambier on 3/1/1894, then Gawler on 13/1/1897. 
<br><br>
He was suspended on 4/12/1899 and discharged on 12/12/1899. I believe the reason to be that he did not “get on” with his superiors - this is hearsay not fact. His listed occupations were boat builder, builder's labourer, carpenter with S.A. Railways, policeman and caretaker of a city building.
<br><br>
On the 5th January 1891 he married Eliza Jane James who was 23 years old having been born on 12 June 1867. Arthur was 22 years old and a police constable in Adelaide.
<br><br>
Eliza's place of residence was listed as Adelaide at the time of their marriage.
<br><br>
The Fathers' names appearing on their marriage certifïcate are Joshua Jarvis and Abel
James. Witnesses were Emma Jarvis (sister to Arthur) and H. Trenery. They were
married at the residence of Mr. Nichols, on the corner of Morphett Street and North
Terrace, Adelaide. Officiating Minister was W.H. Cuse. I assume that Mr. Nichols was
the caretaker of the church - Holy Trinity.
<br><br>
Arthur and Eliza had six children:
<br><br>

	Reginald Lancelot married Eunice Harris - 3 children Ronald, Margaret and Kaye<br>
	Leslie Douglas married Kathleen Robson - 3 children David, Helen, Peter<br>
	Marjorie Edith Alice married Gordon Milkins - no children<br>
<br><br>
After his discharge from the Police Force. the family moved back to Victor Harbor. He had ideas of going fishing, however he obtained a job building railway cottages at Tailem Bend.
<br><br>
Keith Jarvis (grandson) told me he had a reputation for building wooden dinghys and used to get “knees” from the mangroves. He owned a magnificent set of carpenter's tools.
<br><br>
Arthur was a member of the Lifesaving Club and the Victor Harbor Municipal Band.
<br><br>
In 1914 he joined the Army along with his three eldest sons Keith, Harold and Roy (Copies of enlistment and discharge documents were obtained from the Department of the Army Archives). Reg volunteered but was rejected because of varicose veins. He always said that his father was instrumental in his failure to be accepted for active service.
<br><br>
Arthur joined the Remount Unit on 21 Sept 1915, third squadron A.I.F. His enlistment
papers puts him as 46 years 9 months old, living at Victor Harbor, carpenter, apprentice from the School of Mines with 2 children and wife Eliza. Address Bridge Terrace, Victor Harbor. 
<br><br>
To the question - “Do you now belong or have you ever served in His Majesty's forces?” - The answer was “Yes, the Royal Garrison Artillery - 3 years Mounted Infantry”.
<br><br>
He was paid 6/- per day in wages.
<br><br>
Description on enlistment: Age 46 years 9 months. Height 5 feet 8 inches. Weight 151
lbs (10 stone 11 lbs). Chest measurement 37 - 39 inches. Complexion fair. Eyes hazel.
Hair turning grey. Religion Congregational.
<br><br>
Arthur was sent home from active overseas duty and discharged. The discharge document stated that he was discharged because he suffered from arthritis.  He then joined the Australian Imperial Force, Home service Intelligence Department on 30 September 1916 where he was promoted to Sergeant.
<br><br>
Their son Keith contracted a disease whilst serving at Suez, from swimming in contaminated water. He is buried at Suez. This was a great blow to the family. Along the foreshore at Victor Harbor, Norfolk Island pine trees were planted in memory of the men who were killed whilst on active service, Keith among them.
<br><br>
After the War they moved to Torrensville (ed. correction - Torrens Park) where they lived in Barrelder Road. Roy and Alice Jarvis, built (and owned) this house through a War Service Loan. Roy who worked for the Postmaster Generals Department was often moved interstate or to country areas.
<br><br>
Whilst living here they received occasional visits, on a Sunday afternoon, from “Em and Harry Duell, dairy farmers from Salisbury, their two daughters, and Ede (a single lady)”. Em and Ede were Pa's sisters. The Duell's had a motor car, something that Arthur never owned.
<br><br>
Pa ran a detective agency, was a caretaker of the Liberal Club on North Terrace with a flat provided on the top floor. He and Eliza again lived in Roy's house in Barrelder Road.
<br><br>
When he became sick with complications associated with diabetes, he was admitted to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Ron Jarvis recalls visiting him and describes the visit as follows.
<br><br>
<i>
“I recall visiting him in his sick bed in a ward which must surely have been designed if
not built, during the Crimean War. The room was a long rectangle one with 19 or 20
beds on each side. A central open fireplace provided the only gesture towards comfort."
</i>
<br><br>
No more than three or four chaps could crouch before it, to stir the ashes as necessary.
<br><br>
The rest of the victims lived and died in their beds. Pa had a large carbuncle (ed. large boil) on his forehead and was wandering in his mind when I visited him. Treatment for his diabetes at home had been by a sugar free diet. I don't know if he was ever given Insulin. Pa avoided sugar but usually laced his cups of tea with a couple of tablespoons of honey.”
<br><br>
He died on 16 September 1946 at the Royal Adelaide Hospital and is buried in the West Terrace Cemetery. Two of his pallbearers were his grandsons David and Keith Jarvis. (ed. Keith crossed out his name).
<br><br>
Families often have a “skeleton” in the cupboard to rattle around in a closet. When Mr.
Scott (father of Alice who later married Roy Jarvis) was away overseas during World War 1, Arthur - Pa - had an affair with Mrs. Scott resulting with the birth of Pa's illegitimate daughter Lily Scott. Lily resembled Marj Jarvis in looks and eventually suffered from diabetes and went blind. She was raised as one of the Scott family at their home in Thebarton.
<br><br>
The photograph of Pa at the end of this chapter was taken in his uniform as a member of the “Legion of Frontiersmen”. This was a right-wing organization active in the late l930's and whose aim was to save Australia from Labour politicians. The Legion expired with World War 11.
<br><br>
Arthur was not a good husband, father or provider for his wife and family. He had many “lady” friends and was often absent for long periods from the family home, not supporting them emotionally or financially. 
<br><br>
His wife Eliza was a small, quiet woman, a good sewer of clothes and managed to keep the family fed and clothed only through her own efforts. 
<br><br>
She had a disappointing, unhappy hard life trying to make ends meet. She lived within her own thoughts and used to sing to herself as she went about her daily chores.
<br><br>
Arthur was not well liked by his close family, however, he was a handsome man with a
good personality making many friends and “charming” the ladies, even well into his 70's.
<br><br>
He had no qualms about “borrowing” money from anyone and never attempted to pay it back, mainly living on his wits.
<br><br>
<i>I did not know Arthur “Pa” Jarvis. I would like to thank Ron &. Keith Jarvis; grandsons who passed on their memories which are recorded above. I was also able to gain some insight into the personality of Arthur from Alice (Scott) Jarvis wife of Roy Jarvis.</i>

<h2 id="section23">THE CHILDREN OF ARTHUR AND ELIZA JARVIS</h2>

<h3 id="section24">KEITH</h3>
<p>
Born in Adelaide on the 18/101891 at Victoria Park S.A, the ﬁrst child of Arthur and Eliza. His father was a carpenter with the S.A. Railways building stations. They lived at
Tailem Bend and Mount Gambier, and then Arthur joined the police force and was stationed at Gawler. He remained there until about 1900 when the family returned to live at Victor Harbor. Keith attended school, belonged to the local band, life saving crew, football club etc. He became a ﬁsherman and owned his own boat called the “Vida”. He ﬁshed the coastal waters as far away as Robe and around Kangaroo Island and had crayﬁsh baskets. . He caught seagulls and kept them in a pit which he dug in the backyard of their home in Bridge Street. People in those days out the wings of the
Seagulls and kept them to help keep their gardens free of invading pests.
<br>
World War I came along and Keith joined the Australian Imperial Forces — 6th Reinforce Unit on 8/9/1915.
<br><br>
His particulars are as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reg No. 394 - Rank ABD - Trade, ﬁsherman — Address, Victor Harbor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next of Kin, Eliza Jarvis - Religion, Methodist<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate of pay, 6/- per day - allotment in Aust. 5/- deferred pay 1/-.
<br><br>
Keith embarked at Melbourne on the HIVIAS RMS MOLDAVIA on the 5/10/1915.
This information was found in the ﬁles of the War Memorial records in Canberra.
<br>
Keith fought in the Middle East and after swimming in contaminated water near Cario he contracted a fever and died on 10/12/1916 aged 25 years. He is buried at Suez. This was a sad occasion for the whole family. Keith’s name appears on the “Roll of Honour” at the War Memorial in Canberra. At Victor Harbor there is a row of pines, each tree planted in memory of men from the area who lost their lives. There is a tree for Keith. Keith had not married before he left for overseas with his regiment however he had been engaged and planned to marry on his return.

<p>
Ern Wiliats OAM of Port Elliot was prompted to send in this photograph of the Victor Harbor"Municipal Band in Tanunda Competition of October 30, l937 following last week's notation in From Our Past. Mr Williats, one of what he believes are only three surviving members of that band trip, said the band left Victor by bus at 4.30am on that day, stopping for breakfast at the Adelaide Imperial "Hotel at 7.30am. The band competed in the street march, quick-step competition and music test. When when the photo was taken four members were absent. The players of the cornet, tenor horn, euphonium and the drum major. The band master was the late Bill Palmer and the drum major the late Pearce Hocking of the Hindmarsh Band. Mr. Willats believes he and his brothers Ron and Gordon are the only surviving members of the band that travelled to Tanunda.

<h3 id="section26">ERIC ROY</h3>
<p>
Born 2/6/1896 at Mount Gambier and died at Victor Harbor on 13/11/1967 after suffering a heart attack. He was known as “one of the Jarvis boys” joining in various sporting and local activities and attending school at Victor Harbor. He was born Eric, however was often called Roy or even Bill.
He joined the Australian Imperial Forces in 1915 along with his father and brothers. 5Th Division, Signal Company. No. 3548. Roy was decorated for bravery although he always remained modest about this. He was decorated with the Military Medal and two bars.
<br><br>
He joined the PMG department at Port Elliot as a telegraph messenger when he was 14 years old and transferred to Adelaide living with the Scott family at Thebarton where they owned and ran a general corner store. Here he met Alice Scott and in 1920 after his return from WWI he married Alice and they went by train to Sydney for their honeymoon with very little money. This only goes to show his adventurous nature staying with him all his life. They had two children Keith Scott born in 1923. Keith married Shirley Sanderson and they had three children. Shirley (ed. Jarvis) was born in 1926. Shirley married Gordon Sorensen and they had 3 children..
<br><br>
Roy was a telegraphist with the post office and came home one day and announced that they would be going to Darwin to live. This was in 1923 and Darwin was a small village at the other end of Australia. To travel there you had to firstly catch a train to Melbourne, then Sydney, and a boat then took you around the coast of NSW, Qld. And to the Northern Territory. At that time Alice was pregnant and was advised not to travel until after the birth of her baby. So Roy went on ahead and Alice followed when their son Keith was old enough to travel. They had a wonderful life in primitive conditions, spending two years there before returning to Adelaide. After the birth of their daughter Shirley they again took up another appointment in Darwin. On their return Roy held the position of postmaster at Cook on the Nullarbor Plain, Port Augusta, Ororoo, Port Pirie before returning to Adelaide where Roy was postmaster at Glenelg post office – the largest in the metropolitan area. He retired in July 1961.
<br><br>
Alice adapted to all these outlandish places taking it all in her stride. Both she and Roy
always saw the humorous side of things and lived their lives accordingly. Alice was an
expert cook and excelled at craft and sewing.
<br><br>
They finally retired to Victor Harbor enjoying the area where Roy had spent his boyhood days. They travelled a great deal within Australia in their Morris Minor car. After Roy's death, Alice moved to the city, sold their home and travelled the world. She finally moved to Victoria to be near her daughter Shirley and granddaughters, living in her own unit at the Old Colonist retirement village at Clifton hill. Here she made many friends and continued her craftwork. She did many bus trips around Victoria and managed her own home. At the great age of 96 she gave talks to several groups of people about her life and the early days in Darwin and many other places. She spoke to my Probus group of 100 ladies for an hour, sharing her memories and endearing herself to all. Alice was a very talented lady and lived to be 98 years of age. (2).
<br><br>
Both Peter and I were thrilled to be able to find Auntie Alice here in Melbourne and were privileged to be able to spend time with her in her later years.

<h2 id="section29">LESLIE DOUGLAS JARVIS</h2>

<p>
Born 18 February 1904 died 9 April 1984.
<br><br>
Leslie was born at home in Burke Street, Victor Harbor, South Australia on 18/2/1904,
the fifth son of Eliza and Arthur Jarvis. He spent his childhood at Victor Harbor where he gained a love for the sea, which he never lost. He loved the beaches and the surrounding countryside.
<br><br>
The family later lived in Bridge Road near the mouth of the Hindmarsh River which
enabled Les to constantly investigate the area, playing under the bridge and many is the time that he jumped from the bridge into the water below.
<br><br>
Often he accompanied his older brother Keith on his fishing boat, the Vida, along the
nearby coast. Les told many tales of his boyhood days at Victor - I only wish we had
listened more intently so that I could now record accurately his adventures for his
grandchildren.
<br><br>
Times were hard with money constantly in short supply. They had previously lived in
Burke Street near the town center (it has since been demolished). The house was small with one bedroom and a lean-to kitchen which had a dirt floor, no running water and a laundry tub and copper in the back shed.
<br><br>
Les attended school at Victor Harbor and showed a natural ability and interest in the piano. Unfortunately for him, the family did not own a piano nor could they afford to have him taught. As he grew older, and when one was available he would sit and play by ear.
<br><br>
In 1915 when his father, Arthur and three brothers, Keith, Harold and Roy, enlisted in
World War I, Eliza (Gran) was left at home with Reg (who was not accepted in the forces because he had varicose veins), Les and Marjorie.
<br><br>
Arthur Jarvis was the first to return home having been discharged for medical reasons. Roy and Harold returned safely home but sadly his brother Keith died in Suez in 1916 from a fever contracted after swimming in contaminated water near Cario. Les never recovered from the loss of Keith, mourning him for the remainder of his life.
<br><br>
The family moved to Newton Road, Campbelltown, where they worked on a mixed fruit and vegetable block. Les helped financially by working part time at a nearby dairy milking cows. He then went on to work for Horwood Bagshaw as a boilermaker, doing night courses at the School of Mines in Adelaide.
<br><br>
I heard the following story many times from Les as he reminisced later in his life; on
sighting Kathleen Robson alighting from a tram at the Glynde corner, he asked his mates who she was, announcing that he would many her one day. How he managed to accomplish this I do not know as they moved in different social circles, but he did. At first he was not welcomed as a boy friend for Kathleen as the Robsons thought him unsuitable. 
<br><br>
But love has a way of proving people wrong. The Robsons were wonderful caring down-to-earth people and Les was soon accepted into the family circle. Les and Kath were married on 25 August 1922 at the Methodist parsonage, Henley Beach Road, West Adelaide that today would be either Mile End or Thebarton. Witnesses were Henry Binns Robson and Annie Catherine Robson - Kathleen's parents. Leslie's trade was given as “mixed farming” and Kathleen's as a “typist”.
<br><br>
They lived at the home, which Henry Binns Robson had built for his bride Katie Fryer in 1902, at 116 Montacute Road, Hectorville, and named Binnswood”. They had three
children, Leslie David born in 1922, Helen Catherine born in 1924 and Peter James born in 1932.
<br><br>
Before they were married Les had a pushbike and belonged to the local push bike club. He progressed to a small motor bike, purchasing a Harley Davidson and sidecar after he married. The story related to me was that one day Les spun the motor bike around a corner too fast, tipping Kath and baby David out of the sidecar. No one was hurt physically; maybe Les's pride may have been dented! This may have been the end of his motor bike days!
<br><br>
Les kept quite a number of birds in his Aviary - canaries, budgies, finches and kookaburras. It was legal to keep kookaburras in captivity in the mid l930's. The kookas were very friendly and tame. When a gardening session was in progress they were let out of their cage and had a great time hunting for worms. Unfortunately, he developed an allergy for feathers and so he was not able to continue to keep them. Kath knew about native birds - when they would migrate, when they would return. 
<br><br>
She could identify the different species, their habitat, and how many chicks they were likely to raise. No doubt this knowledge was gained from her father and grandfather who ran the orchard. Kath passed this love of birds and nature on to her children.
<br><br>
Les went to work as a foreman for his father-in-law, Henry Robson known affectionately to all the family as “Bope”. The property owned by Thomas Binns Robson and then Henry Binns, was section 280 and consisted at this time of 100 acres. They grew stone fruits, figs and olives, and also owned a nearby vineyard and an orchard in the hills. Cash crops of vegetables were grown between the rows of trees and the surplus fruit and vegetables were taken to the East End market and sold. In the spring a tent community sprung up as students from schools and universities swarmed in to pick the fruit.
<br><br>
Bope and Nannan (as Katie Robson was known to her family) were of the Quaker religion and in running his business Bope, during the depression, kept on all staff members rather than dismiss even one person. He ran into financial difficulties because of this and finally the Bank of Adelaide, with whom they dealt foreclosed in 1934. Leslie and Charlie Robson, son of Henry, entered a scheme of arrangement with the Bank to repay the debt under the trade name of Robson Jarvis & Company. Kath Jarvis ran the office and Les and Charlie took over the factory work involved in running a jam processing business. The fruit was grown in the orchard and processed in the factory. They produced preserved and dried fruits, pickled olives, olive oil and non-alcoholic grape juice.
<br><br>
The Second World War 1939-1945, created a demand for dehydrated vegetables -
particularly potatoes and cabbage - for use in military canteens and field kitchens. Robson Jarvis & Co. successfully tendered for a portion of this business and supplied both Australian and American services. This put them on their feet quickly and the bank loan was repaid. As the equipment and vehicles were supplied free of charge under “The Lend Lease Scheme” by the American Forces there was no looking back. It did, however, take many long hours of labour and intensive work to meet the demands of the Forces. A staff of about 40 was employed during the war, which included 14 Land Army girls who lived in the “Ellythorp” house adjacent to the factory.
<br><br>
As money became available to the partners, and with the bank debt repaid, they purchased what was known as the “Ellythorp block” and a vineyard at the top of Montacute Road.
<br><br>
Charlie made the choice not to purchase any further land whilst Les and Kath purchased the “Cosford block” and invested in small farms at Snowtown in the state's north which they share farmed for many years.
<br><br>
After the war, the factory continued to process fruit, pickled olives and grape juice, using the produce grown in the orchard which had been planted by Kath's grandfather
T.B.Robson. It became a much smaller production line, which Charlie ran on his own,
Kath still working as office manager.
<br><br>
Meanwhile Les in partnership with Edgar Sims built a factory on the “Cosford” block in 1942. They first supplied dehydrated vegetables to the Australian and American troops in conjunction with Robson Jarvis & Co. After the war ended they brought fruit in from
areas along the River Murray and began processing fruit. As much of the orchard had
been subdivided and sold for building blocks, they were no longer able to supply their own fruit.
<br><br>
David Jarvis who had returned from serving with the Airforce, ran this factory for several years.
<br><br>
Helen Jarvis assisted her mother with the general running of the home and in the office until her marriage to Stewart Brougham in 1945.
<br><br>
Les began selling land on the Cosford block and people soon built houses enlarging the population in the area quickly.
<br><br>
Les and Kath bought a block of land at Brighton, planing to build their retirement home close to the sea, which Les loved so much. This did not eventuate and they finally built a new home at 132 Montacute Road. They moved out of Binswood and their son Peter and his family lived there for the first few years of their married life. Binswood was then sold having been in the Robson family for 60 odd years and was demolished to make way for a new home. Henry Binns Robson and his wife Katie, who had been living a Cosford for many years, moved to Ellythorp next to the factory and Cosford was sold. Hemy (Bope) lived on at Ellythorp, after the death of his wife Katie, until his death in 1955,
<br><br>
The Ellythorp block changed, as building blocks were sold, encompassing streets with
houses. (The streets took on family names e.g. Binnswood, Robson, Henry, Watson, Ellythorp, Curtis, Jarvis, Cosford and Katherine.) The S.A. Government purchased 9 acres in 1962 and the building of the Newton Primary School began on the ground that had grown fruit trees from the earliest days of South Australia. The first head master of Newton School was Bert Arthur - Beryl Jarvis's father. He soon had trees planted, playing fields laid, the children enrolled and it became a Class 1 school. Bert and Elva purchased land from Les and built a home at 138 Montacute Road.
<br><br>
Les sold his interest in Fruveg Horticulturist Ltd. and Robson Jarvis closed down. The
factory was sold and demolished to make way for a new housing development. Les and Kath retired and did several trips within Australia. They had as a hobby, photography. Kath took prize winning slides and Les had a movie camera and projector. They joined the “Filmo Club” and shared many happy hours with friends within this Club. They attended conventions in Brisbane, Sydney and Perth also travelling to country towns. They opened their home to club members. They made home movies of family and friends, which are today, a treasure to us all.
<br><br>
Les was a member of the Freemasons Lodge at Payneham and Epworth, becoming Master at Epworth.
<br><br>
In their retirement they enjoyed visiting their families who had moved away from Adelaide. David and Miriam were living at Keith, Helen and Stewart were firstly at Lucindale,
<br><br>
Adelong and finally at Mangrove Mountain near Gosford, whilst Peter and Beryl moved to Mildura, Wagga Wagga, Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne. They loved to drive and visit the beauty spots and towns along the way. As old age crept up on them they learnt to fly especially as Kath's health deteriorated.
<br><br>
Kath suffered several mild strokes making it diffïcult for them to manage to run the house. They were able to find suitable help and stay in their home. Kath died on 1st April 1981 after which Les found life very lonely indeed after their 59 years of marriage.
<br><br>
He stayed on at home, visiting his family whenever he could; David was now living back in Adelaide.
<br><br>
Les became involved in a business venture with an Italian family, which proved disastrous. He went on his first overseas trip to Italy with Ross Zito and saw a little of Europe. He particularly loved Austria. This was a stressfull trip and he returned with back problems.
<br><br>
The association with Ross had begun before Kath's death and was a worry to her. She was an astute business woman and could see the pitfalls that lay ahead. It became a great worry and caused anxiety to Les and to his children, costing him a great deal of money.
<br><br>
However, it was his choice and his life to live the way he wished. This he did regardless of opinions of others and the ultimate outcome. He was a lonely man looking for companionship. Most of his family lived interstate and many friends had died. What he wanted was a constant friend to help fill in the time. He was not slightly interested in joining an elderly club saying that he didn't want to become involved with “old people”.
<br><br>
He celebrated his 80th birthday with a lunch at Terrigal with Helen, Stewart, Peter and
Beryl. A week or so later he visited Peter in Melbourne and celebrated with a party which included both grandchildren and great grandchildren.
<br><br>
He really missed Kath and on the 9th April, 1984 he came home from a meeting with his bank manager, from whom he hadn't received good news, had a heart attack, collapsed and died. He was 80 years old.
<br><br>
Les came from a poor family, had worked hard during his life time, had not had the benefit of a good education nor a happy family home life (before his marriage) as his father was absent for long periods and money was always scarce. His mother worked long hard hours in the home and took in sewing to supplement their income.
<br><br>
Luck helped when World War II brought in the Government contracts helping to repay
bank loans and making enough money to invest in and buy land.
<br><br>
They were most grateful that their son David came home safely from World War II, he
was proud of his children's achievements and loved his grandchildren and great grandchildren. There were 8 grandchildren and 28 great grandchildren.
<br><br>
Les on the whole enjoyed good health, although early in their married life he had his
appendix removed after which there were serious complications. There were several other operations later in life and he developed an allergy to penicillin and dairy foods. These caused swelling of his tongue and face. In his late 70's he developed angina and had tablets to help when necessary. Over all he was a well, strong, healthy man. Only a small man about 5'6 with dark hair and brown eyes - a legacy from his Welsh and Cornish ancestry.
<br><br>
Les and Kath were both cremated and their ashes were scattered, as they had requested, along the banks of Fourth Creek which ran through the edge of their property on Montacute Road.
<br><br>
Their home and remaining property was sold after the death of Les, and so the property, which had originally been purchased by the Robson family for their orchard, passed into other hands.
<br><br>
<b>Helen Kathleen Robson - Jarvis</b>
<br><br>
Kathleen, as she was known, was born on the 12th October, 1903 at Hectorville. She was the first child of Henry and Katie Robson, who lived at “Binswood” on Montacute Road, Hectorville. She lived a privileged lifestyle attending the private school “Poltoonga” in Harrow Road, St. Peters. Afterwards attending Muirden Business College where she successfully completed a shorthand, typing and book-keeping course. Kath worked in the office of the family business, T. B. Robson & Son.
<br><br>
Kath often spoke of her happy childhood, growing up on the Robson property. She rode horses, learnt about nature and how to drive a car. Her grandparents lived nearby and she was brought up in a Quaker home, open at all times to everyone.
<br><br>
After she married in 1922 I have interwoven her life with that of Les and covered her
family life in the “Robson” family history. .
<br><br>
Kath was admired for her determination and strength of character especially after she suffered several strokes. She remained alert and interested in her family. She was a dear, caring little lady who was respected and loved by all.
<br><br>
Our children were fortunate in living within walking distance of their grandparents and
visited them almost daily for the first 10 years of their lives. She was interested in her
grandchildren and always found time to listen to whatever they had to say.
<br><br>

<h3>The children of Les and Kath Jarvis</h3>

<p>
<b>Leslie David Jarvis</b> born on the 23rd December 1922.
<br><br>
David as he is known, lived with his family at “Binswood” on Montacute Road. At that
time the family orchard surrounded the property. David attended Payneharn School, and Norwood High School. He went to the Newton Methodist Church. When he was 15
years old he joined the Shell Company on North Terrace, Adelaide working in the office as a clerk. Here he met Miriam Slade, whom he later married. He joined the Royal
Australian Air Force on the 12 September 1942. He underwent a Pilots' and Navigators' Course at Victor Harbor and Ballarat in Victoria before leaving to serve in New Guinea and Islands in the Pacific. He was discharged in February 1946 with the rank of Flight Lieutenant, having received the Pacific Star. David and Miriam were married in March 1945.
<br><br>
After the war David worked in the family business, managing the Fruveg factory where they were processing fruit; then managed a local garage and petrol station at Payneham, after which he and Miriam moved to Keith where he ran and managed a cattle property for his brother-in-law John Slade. When the property was sold, David and Miriam moved back to Adelaide. David returned to study at Flinders University. enabling him to become a supervisor at the sheltered workshop for handicapped people run by the Phoenix Society at Torrensville until retirement on his 65th birthday.
<br><br>
David and Miriam had two children Mark James and Anne Kathleen. Mark worked for
the Taxation Department and Anne is a Veterinary Surgeon.
<br><br>
There are 7 grandchildren.
<br><br>
<b>Helen Catherine Brougham</b> was born on the 11th September 1924.
<br><br>
Helen was educated at Payneham school and Norwood High School. She attended Newton Methodist Church and later Payneham Methodist Church. As a young girl she loved to keep and care for “creepy-crawly things”, according to her brother Peter. She loved lizards, frogs and insects. She went to Norwood High School and was disappointed when she was not able to continue on with her education because of her mother's health. Helen was required to stay at home and help, later working in the family office at Robson, Jarvis & Co.
<br><br>
She met Stewart Brougham a local Payneham boy and they married in 1945. Stewart
worked firstly as a carpenter, then started his own business in partnership with Jim
Marshall. The company, Marshall & Brougham, was a building company. They lived at
Glenunga for several years then Stewart resigned from the firm and they bought a property at Lucindale in the South East of S.A. Here they cleared the land and ran cattle and grew crops. This was successful and they moved on to a better property at Adelong in NSW.
<br><br>
Next move was to Mangrove Mountain in NSW near Gosford where they bought a smaller property, running fewer cattle and growing flowers on a commercial scale.
<br><br>
Stewart died unexpectedly in 1995 and Helen remains on running the property most
successfully with the help of casual local employees.
<br><br>
Helen fitted into country life in the various places, joining the local Country Women's
Association and taking a leading role, playing tennis, took an active role in the local church activities including the playing of the organ for Sunday services, weddings etc.
<br><br>
Helen and Stewart had four children, Susan, Melanie, Alison and Andrew. All but Alison lives in country areas of NSW. They have 19 grand children.
<br><br>
<b>Peter James Jarvis</b> born on the 2nd December 1932.
<br><br>
Peter also, grew up on the family property, having wide open spaces to wander and play in. He went to Payneham school and the Payneham Methodist Church. In those days most social activities were associated with schools and church. He later went to Adelaide High School and Adelaide Technical School. He spent many hours in the orchard with his grandfather and Uncle Charlie from whom he learnt many practical things. When he was just 16 and old enough to obtain his driving licence he used to drive a truck carting fruit from country areas to the factory at Hectorville, whenever he could. He loved to drive. He spent many of his school holidays on the farm at Snowtown. Here his parents were share-farmers with the Stevens family who became the best of friends. It was here that he rode horses, drove tractors and helped generally with work on the farm.
<br><br>
He was fortunate as his parents, especially after the War, were comfortably off financially, something they had not been for the two older children. He had his first motor bike, a BSA when he was 16, a sports car a Ford Anglia when he was 18, a Singer sports car at 19.
<br><br>
He went to Work at Dalgety's a Ford distributor in Adelaide. He then sold Holden and
second hand cars at the family business at Payneham. The lure of the motor vehicle took him to drive for Coca Cola all over the State, finally managing depots in Mildura and Sales Manager in Wagga Wagga.
<br><br>
He moved to Sydney where he joined Golden Fleece as a sales representative working in all country areas over a period of several years. He transferred back to Adelaide with the firm and it was thought this would be the last move. But promotion came along as Sales Manager in Melbourne, which he accepted. He was soon promoted to State Manager where he remained until a takeover bid terminated many employees including Peter.
<br><br>
He ventured into a business partnership in advertising electronic signs and finally managed a fuel depot before retiring. During these years he was fortunate enough to do several overseas business trips. Previously he and Beryl had been able to have four overseas trips.
<br><br>
After retirement they bought a large caravan and four wheel drive and travelled to
outback areas and towns discovering our wonderful country scenery. This they did for
several years loving every minute of it. They are now living in suburban Melbourne.
<br><br>
Peter and Beryl were married in 1952 and have two children Jennifer and Steven. They have 4 grandchildren.

<h2 id="section31">ABLE JAMES & MARY MILLS</h2>

<h3>James - Mills families</h3>

<p>
When the ship the “Marion” arrived at Port Adelaide, South Australia, in 1857 on board
was a young lad of 15 years old named Abel Fruhollas James. Born September 1842 at Abergavenny, Wales. Abel's parents were John (labourer) and Eliza James. (This was verified on his wedding certificate where his father was named as John James). The family settled firstly at Jamestown then eventually moved to Balaklava.
<br><br>
The following appeared in the “Register” on 2 March 1867:
<br><br>
Under Personal Notices - Marriages.
<br><br>
On the 29th February at St. John's Auburn, by licence by the Rev. J. B.
Titherington Abel James to Mary Mills both of Lower Wakefield.
<br><br>
The marriage certifiate gives details as follows:
<br><br>
No. 4 of 1867, District Gilbert. Date 28 February 1867.
<br><br>
Abel James aged 25, labourer, residence Lower Wakefield, father John
James, Church St. John's Auburn.
<br><br>
Mary Mills aged 23, residence Lower Wakefield, father John Mills.
Abel left his mark "X" whilst Mary signed her name.
<br><br>
Witnesses were: Catherine Mills and Samuel Mills both signing there
mark "X" and both living at Lower Wakefïeld.
<br><br>
Marriage performed by J. B. Thitherington.
<br><br>
Mary Mills was born in Redruth, Comwalli in 1844 and travelled with her parents on the ship “Chatham” in 1846 when she was only two years old. Her father John Mills, his occupation listed as a miner, born c1815 died in January 1879 and is buried in the
Balaklava cemetery. Her mother Eliza (Vere) was born c1819 and died in November
1892. Buried in the Balaklava cemetery.
<br><br>
Mary and Abel James had the following children:
<br><br>
	Eliza Jane 		born 12 June, 1867 	died 23/6/1955 aged 88 years
<br><br>
				married Arthur Harold Jarvis
<br><br>
	Catherine 		born 27 August, 1869
<br><br>
	Mary Ann 		born 24 November, 1871 	died 16/3/1918 aged 47 years
<br><br>
				Spinster - had 1 child Dora and they lived in Balaklava.
	Alice Edith 		born 18 February, 1874 died 15/1/1960 aged 88 years
<br><br>
				Spinster - lived with her brother Jack several miles out of 
				the town of Balaklava.
<br><br>
	Matilda Maria 	born 16 September, 1875.  Married Frank Ayliffe 2 children
				Melville and Stella (lived in Freemantle W.A.)
<br><br>
	John Abel (Jack)	born 3 May, 1876 died 12 September, 1957 aged 81 years
				Bachelor lived with his sister Alice (as above)
<br><br>
	Michael Samuel 	(Mick) born 1 May, 1882 died 1960 aged 78 years
				married Elsie Gates and they had one child Jessie.
<br><br>
In the S. A Register 1893 - 1900 Abel was stated to be a builder at Balaklava born c1842.
<br><br>
Alice and Jack who never married lived together near the town of Balaklava - These
details were found in Kath Jarvis’s hand writing and veriﬁed by Births, Deaths and
Marriage records of S.A. The B.D.& M. records, Adelaide could not ﬁnd a registration
for the birth of Eliza Jane. She was raised as the sister of the other children so one
assumes that the family did not register her birth at the time and just forgot about it as happened in those days. I have in my possession Eliza’s - or Gran Jarvis as we all knew her - Bible in which she has recorded her birth date and those of her children.
<br><br>
I obtained a copy of the birth certiﬁcate for Alice James, sister of Eliza, (and have included a copy ) to prove that Able and Mary Ann were the correct parents.
<br><br>
The two James boys’ - Jack and Micks’ main claim to fame was that they walked four
miles into Balaklava each week to slate their considerable thirsts. They were farm labourers by occupation. I do not think that Alice did anything but work at home.
<br><br>
I remember calling at their home just outside Balaklava once or twice, for afternoon tea, with Les and Kath Jarvis. It was a small low house and did not seem to have any
“modcons”. The food was home made and delicious. Alice was a member of the
Balaklava CWA and on her 80th birthday they held a special afternoon in her honour.. She was nearly doubled over with arthritis and no doubt suffered a great deal.
<br><br>
Abel James died at Parkside Asylum on the 4th February 1906 aged 63 years. Registration District Norwood. His profession was stated as “mason” and the cause of death was recorded as “senile decay and diarrhea for 4 months”. He is buried at West Terrace cemetery. Date of registration of death was 6 February 1906.
<br><br>
In Book 2 - Coroners reports S.A. - Abel James 5/2/1906 age 63.
Page 61. source GR G 1/44 Coroners reports from the Police.
Abel James aged 63 years. Date of death 4/2/1906. Male. Ref 119 Admission 119/05.
<br><br>
Mary James, wife of Abel, died on 12 October 1922 at age 78. At that time she had been a widow for 16 years. The following appeared on her death certificate:
<br><br>
Widow of the late Abel Fruhollas James, labourer, Balaklava. Residence
Balaklava. Born in Cornwall, U.K. and had lived in S.A. for 76 years.
<br><br>
It was recorded that she had been 19 years old when married and bore 2 male children and 5 females, one of whom had predeceased her. Cause of death was “senile decay”. She died at Balaklava and is buried . in the cemetery there.
<br><br>
Whether Eliza James met Arthur Jarvis when the family were in the Jamestown/Clare area around 1876/77 I do not know. Maybe Mary Ann stayed on for a time after her husband Joshua’s accident and death in 1877. Or maybe Eliza and her parents were living in Adelaide prior to the time of Abel’s death in 1906. Maybe Eliza had moved to Adelaide to gain employment. No matter what, one can only speculate as to how Eliza and Arthur met. They married in Adelaide in January 1891. On the marriage certificate it stated that Eliza’s place of residence was Adelaide. Arthur’s occupation was stated as ‘police constable” and residence as Adelaide.
<br><br>
----------------------------------------------------------
<br><br>
ABERGAVENNY — GWENT — WALES. (18 miles north of Newport) Beyond this busy market town on the River Usk stretches the splendour of the Brecon Beacons National Park.
<br><br>
The ruins of the castle (AM) built by the Norman, Harnrnelin de Baladon soon after the Conquest, are thought to cover the foundations of the Roman Fort Gobannium which produced coins, bricks and various other Roman relics. Today a Museun in the grounds attracts many visitors.
<br><br>
St. Mary’s in Monk Street is the original church of the 11”‘ century Benedictine priory and has interesting altar tombs. An old stone bridge of seven arches takes the public road across the Usk. The buildings on Main Street represent many periods. Old Court — a house built into the town wall — dates from 1500. The Town Hall is a ﬁne Gothic building in grey stone erected in 1873. Attached to it are the spacious market
house and coin exchange. The lunatic asylum for the nearby counties of Monmouth, Brecan and Radnor, is a handsome grey stone building in the early English style. Situated on a hill overlooking the town, it was erected in 1851 with considerable extensions since then and I believe today it is used as a hospital.
<br><br>
The town was formerly famous for Welsh flannel and for fashionable Welsh wigs made from goat’s hair. It is now notable, chiefly, for the traffic of neighbouring coal and iron works and especially for crowded markets. These are held on a Tuesday with a fruit and vegetable market on a Friday. It has an excellent water supply and an ancient drainage system
<br><br>
The town gives a title of Marquis to the family of Neville. The Marquis of Abergavenny is Lord of the Manor and the chief land owner. The parish includes the town and a large proportion of the land is “hill-sheepwalk”. (Pasture is not fenced and sheep have right away on public roads)
<br><br>
REDRUTH — Here you can see a <a href="https://www.britainexpress.com/counties/cornwall/Historic-Properties/wheal-peevor.htm">winding engine</a> of 1887 and a pumping engine built in 1892, which have been preserved by the National Trust. As this may suggest Redruth was at the centre of Comwall’s tin and copper industries in the 1850’s. The country’s output of copper ore amounted to 209,000 tons or two million pounds of revenue. Nowadays such employment as there is comes from light industries that have sprouted in the vicinity. It was the birth place of the inventor Riachard Trevithick in 1771 who in 1801 built the ﬁrst passenger steam vehicle.
<br><br>
On their wedding certificate Mary’s age is stated as 23 years. On her death certificate it states she was 19 years old at the time of her marriage.
<br><br>
This only goes to show how mistakes occur especially when information relies on the informant at that time.

<h2 id="section34">CORNWALL - Redruth</h2>

<h3>The County of Cornwall</h3><p>
A small county on a long promontory on the south west tip of England which terminates at “Land’s End”. The County is bounded on the east by Devonshire whilst on the north, south and west there is sea.
<br><br>
The Cornish language, no longer spoken is preserved in place names within the county and in old books, many of which are in the library in Penzance, Cornwall. There are many archaeological treasures and early English ruins attracting many tourists..
<br><br>
Picturesque cliff scenery and a rugged coastline with rocky promontories which shelter peaceful bays leading gently to green meadows on higher land, made a natural haven for pirates and smuggling in earlier times.
<br><br>
The fishing industry is important. whilst the Cornish tin and copper mines have been
there since ancient times although most are now closed. <b>Around Redruth, where the Mills family originated there were mines and John Mills worked there.</b>

<br>Old Cornwall tin mine<br>
</center>

<p>
Tin and copper, the essential metals of bronze, began to be mined in Cornwall in the Bronze Age. With
the coming of the Celts the industry developed and tin was shipped from Cornwall all over Europe and, of
course, to the rest of lowland Britain. Tin lodes are found Within Cornwall‘s granite rocks, mostly in a belt
stretching from near Land's End to Camborne and Redruth, and copper deposits are found in the nearby shale. From the medieval period right up until the middle of the Victorian era, tin was Cornwall’s chief source of employment and prosperity. In the 1860's, though, many of the older mines were worked out, and competition from southeast Asia
and South America crippled the industry. Thousands of out-of-work miners emigrated to the colonies, leaving gaunt ruins at places like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botallack_Mine">Botallack</a>, pictured below, and Camborne near Redruth (above) all over the area. Efforts to revive the industry have not been successful.

The occupation of 'miner' who worked in Cornwall is described as Poorer classes who
sought work wherever it was available. If they didn’t have a trade then they would
drift into whatever was available in their area. A miner did not need to be educated
or need a trade or apprenticeship. Women were employed to work above ground.
The early "tinners" as they were called, or miners worked in the open gathering tin from the rocks where the ore was exposed. The lighter waste washed away from the gravel, whilst the heavier stones were pounded into powder and taken to the furnace for smelting.
<br><br>
These men had the right to search for tin and work the site, on any waste land, paying the lord of the manor a toll thus establishing himself as his own master. If he found the ore a profit was made, if not he was a loser. This put him in a unique position amongst his fellow men. He was not a serf, servant or hired labour but a free man working for himself alone.
<br><br>
Once the tin had been smelted it was taken to a "coinage" where it was weighed and
stamped by an Officer of the Crown, to be sold to foreign traders, any proﬁt going to the miner himself.
<br><br>
They continued to work in the open, using pick and shovel, changing their work place as deposits became exhausted. Sometimes these deposits would be a considerable distance from the village, then they would build themselves a moor-house near their work. These moor-houses were bare and sparse ~ one long windowless room where they ate and slept, with a hearth where they could burn turf, placing turf or heather on the dirt floor to sleep on at night. The winter days would be hard beyond belief, with strong winds driving the rain across the moors and it would be dark by half past four in the afternoon. If the food they brought with them ran out, they would then have to trap rabbits, or shoot wild bird life that came to feed beside the pools and marshes, then in their rough shelters cook their catch. They would then sit around telling each other the legends of the past.
<br><br>
Tin and copper mining below the surface began about the middle of the 15th century. As shafts were sunk deeper and tunnels grew longer so the work became harder and more dangerous. The miners had to crawl along the tunnels, working half bent at times with a candle fixed to the brim of his hat, for as long as eight hours a day in hot stagnant air. The sinking of the shafts, the use of timber ladders and ropes, candles, moving of the earth itself, the danger of accidents to life and limb, were the problems experienced by the miners working underground in contrast to their previous counterparts who worked in the open air. The men had the added strain of having to climb hundreds of feet upwards on ladders, which took an estimated one third of their energy, to reach the surface. Eventually a cage-like device was used to haul the men upwards.
<br><br>
During the 17th and 18th century the price of tin and copper fell and the loss of the miners income was serious. Many of these came to starving point and in desperation raided farms and villages for food. The ordinary folk of Cornwall feared them and blamed them for any disturbance that occurred. They became known as a violent bunch of men, when in fact they were not.
<br><br>
The beginning of the 19th century saw a boom in Cornish mining. Roads improved, foundries and engineering works were built and steam engines were introduced. The mine owners became rich, whilst the miners themselves worked long hours for poor
wages. In fact it was hard to get a job at all. They had come a long way from the early "tinners" who worked on the open moors. Disease took its toll; the average life span of a miner working underground was 47 years. If he survived the frequent accidents, the heart and lung problems, the colds and chills that were common after working in the stifling heat underground, only to confront the wet cold conditions when he reached the surface. Then to end his day in an overcrowded cottage, spitting black dust; existing on a diet of potatoes and barley gruel. There was no trade union or government body to fight for his cause.
<br><br>
In the middle of the 19th century Cornwall was the largest copper-producing district in the world. Some fifty thousand people were working the mines. The boom reached its peak by the late 1860s when the market began to fail as copper had now been found overseas.
<br><br>
A third of the mining population left Cornwall taking their skills to other countries - to
America, South Africa and Australia, whilst back in Cornwall the mining towns and villages were deserted. The land reverted once more to barren waste and scrub.
<br><br>
Today the mines are long gone and small farming is practiced with intensive cultivation and cropping. Fishing continues along the coastal towns and tourism brings in good revenue.
<br><br>
Whether men worked as miners, tradesmen, farmers or shopkeepers once the mines failed their incomes were depleted and many families left their homes seeking a better life in the new country across the sea - Australia.
<br><br>
I could not leave Cornwall without mentioning three of their favourite delicacies —
Saffron cakes - made with plenty of currants, lemon peel and saffron.
<br><br>
Kiddley broth - made by pouring boiling water over pieces of bread, adding a small lump of butter and plenty of pepper and salt. It is tasty and often served for breakfast.
<br><br>
Cornish pasty - the usual Cornish pasty is “beef and tatty” - potato with or without onion and a little turnip.
<br><br>
When we were visiting Penzance, I was able to spend time with an elderly Cornish lady who told me her version of the Cornish pasty. She said that in the early days, when the men worked above ground, the women used to bake the pasties and take them to the men at lunch time. They placed the savoury mixture one end, adding jam to the other and putting two layers of pastry around it all. This gave them both a savoury and a sweet meal all in one. A billy of tea completed their meal. As arsenic was often present on the hands of the men, as they ate, they peeled off the outer layer of pastry so as not to swallow the toxic substance.

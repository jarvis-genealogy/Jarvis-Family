<h3 id="section24">KEITH</h3>
<p>
Born in Adelaide on the 18/10/1891 at Victoria Park S.A, the ﬁrst child of Arthur and Eliza. His father was a carpenter with the S.A. Railways building stations. They lived at Tailem Bend and Mount Gambier, and then Arthur joined the police force and was stationed at Gawler. He remained there until about 1900 when the family returned to live at Victor Harbor. Keith attended school, belonged to the local band, life saving crew, football club etc. He became a ﬁsherman and owned his own boat called the “Vida”. He ﬁshed the coastal waters as far away as Robe and around Kangaroo Island and had crayﬁsh baskets. He caught seagulls and kept them in a pit which he dug in the backyard of their home in Bridge Street. People in those days cut the wings of the Seagulls and kept them to help keep their gardens free of invading pests.
<br>
World War I came along and Keith joined the Australian Imperial Forces — 6th Reinforce Unit on 8/9/1915.
<br><br>
His particulars are as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reg No. 394 - Rank ABD - Trade, ﬁsherman — Address, Victor Harbor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next of Kin, Eliza Jarvis - Religion, Methodist<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate of pay, 6/- per day - allotment in Aust. 5/- deferred pay 1/-.
<br><br>
Keith embarked at Melbourne on the HIVIAS RMS MOLDAVIA on the 5/10/1915.
This information was found in the ﬁles of the War Memorial records in Canberra.
<br><br>
Keith fought in the Middle East and after swimming in contaminated water near Cario he contracted a fever and died on 10/12/1916 aged 25 years. He is buried at Suez. This was a sad occasion for the whole family. Keith’s name appears on the “Roll of Honour” at the War Memorial in Canberra. At Victor Harbor there is a row of pines, each tree planted in memory of men from the area who lost their lives. There is a tree for Keith. Keith had not married before he left for overseas with his regiment however he had been engaged and planned to marry on his return.

<h3 id="section25">HAROLD ARTHUR</h3>
<p>
Born 1/ 8/ 1894 at Mount Gambier and died on 22/9/1946 at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. Harold lived much of his life with his brother Keith, joining in sporting and local activities in the areas where the family lived. He attended school at Victor Harbor and joined the Royal Imperial Forces in WW1 - 2nd Remount, 16th Battalion. No. 1323 along with his father and two brothers.
<br><br>
On his return he married a local girl, Isobelle, known as Belle, Whiting and they lived at Port Elliot, a few miles south of Victor Harbor. Belle died on 23/3/1959. They had one daughter named "Peggy” who married Adrian Ottaway and they had five children, the eldest was killed  a road accident, twin girls deceased and Gillian is sadly what people call a “bag lady” in Victor Harbor. (Information given to me by David Jarvis in June 1997).

<h3 id="section26">ERIC ROY</h3>
<p>
Born 2/6/1896 at Mount Gambier and died at Victor Harbor on 13/11/1967 after suffering a heart attack. He was known as “one of the Jarvis boys” joining in various sporting and local activities and attending school at Victor Harbor. He was born Eric, however was often called Roy or even Bill.
He joined the Australian Imperial Forces in 1915 along with his father and brothers. 5Th Division, Signal Company. No. 3548. Roy was decorated for bravery although he always remained modest about this. He was decorated with the Military Medal and two bars.
<br><br>
He joined the PMG department at Port Elliot as a telegraph messenger when he was 14 years old and transferred to Adelaide living with the Scott family at Thebarton where they owned and ran a general corner store. Here he met Alice Scott and in 1920 after his return from WWI he married Alice and they went by train to Sydney for their honeymoon with very little money. This only goes to show his adventurous nature staying with him all his life. They had two children Keith Scott born in 1923. Keith married Shirley Sanderson and they had three children. Shirley (ed. Jarvis) was born in 1926. Shirley married Gordon Sorensen and they had 3 children..
<br><br>
Roy was a telegraphist with the post office and came home one day and announced that they would be going to Darwin to live. This was in 1923 and Darwin was a small village at the other end of Australia. To travel there you had to firstly catch a train to Melbourne, then Sydney, and a boat then took you around the coast of NSW, Qld. And to the Northern Territory. At that time Alice was pregnant and was advised not to travel until after the birth of her baby. So Roy went on ahead and Alice followed when their son Keith was old enough to travel. They had a wonderful life in primitive conditions, spending two years there before returning to Adelaide. After the birth of their daughter Shirley they again took up another appointment in Darwin. On their return Roy held the position of postmaster at Cook on the Nullarbor Plain, Port Augusta, Ororoo, Port Pirie before returning to Adelaide where Roy was postmaster at Glenelg post office – the largest in the metropolitan area. He retired in July 1961.
<br><br>
Alice adapted to all these outlandish places taking it all in her stride. Both she and Roy
always saw the humorous side of things and lived their lives accordingly. Alice was an
expert cook and excelled at craft and sewing.
<br><br>
They finally retired to Victor Harbor enjoying the area where Roy had spent his boyhood days. They travelled a great deal within Australia in their Morris Minor car. After Roy's death, Alice moved to the city, sold their home and travelled the world. She finally moved to Victoria to be near her daughter Shirley and granddaughters, living in her own unit at the Old Colonist retirement village at Clifton hill. Here she made many friends and continued her craftwork. She did many bus trips around Victoria and managed her own home. At the great age of 96 she gave talks to several groups of people about her life and the early days in Darwin and many other places. She spoke to my Probus group of 100 ladies for an hour, sharing her memories and endearing herself to all. Alice was a very talented lady and lived to be 98 years of age. (2).
<br><br>
Both Peter and I were thrilled to be able to find Auntie Alice here in Melbourne and were privileged to be able to spend time with her in her later years.

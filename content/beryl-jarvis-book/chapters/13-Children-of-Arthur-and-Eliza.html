<h3 id="section24">KEITH</h3>
<p>
Born in Adelaide on the 18/101891 at Victoria Park S.A, the ﬁrst child of Arthur and Eliza. His father was a carpenter with the S.A. Railways building stations. They lived at
Tailem Bend and Mount Gambier, and then Arthur joined the police force and was stationed at Gawler. He remained there until about 1900 when the family returned to live at Victor Harbor. Keith attended school, belonged to the local band, life saving crew, football club etc. He became a ﬁsherman and owned his own boat called the “Vida”. He ﬁshed the coastal waters as far away as Robe and around Kangaroo Island and had crayﬁsh baskets. . He caught seagulls and kept them in a pit which he dug in the backyard of their home in Bridge Street. People in those days out the wings of the
Seagulls and kept them to help keep their gardens free of invading pests.
<br>
World War I came along and Keith joined the Australian Imperial Forces — 6th Reinforce Unit on 8/9/1915.
<br><br>
His particulars are as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reg No. 394 - Rank ABD - Trade, ﬁsherman — Address, Victor Harbor.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next of Kin, Eliza Jarvis - Religion, Methodist<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rate of pay, 6/- per day - allotment in Aust. 5/- deferred pay 1/-.
<br><br>
Keith embarked at Melbourne on the HIVIAS RMS MOLDAVIA on the 5/10/1915.
This information was found in the ﬁles of the War Memorial records in Canberra.
<br>
Keith fought in the Middle East and after swimming in contaminated water near Cario he contracted a fever and died on 10/12/1916 aged 25 years. He is buried at Suez. This was a sad occasion for the whole family. Keith’s name appears on the “Roll of Honour” at the War Memorial in Canberra. At Victor Harbor there is a row of pines, each tree planted in memory of men from the area who lost their lives. There is a tree for Keith. Keith had not married before he left for overseas with his regiment however he had been engaged and planned to marry on his return.

<h3 id="section26">ERIC ROY</h3>
<p>
Born 2/6/1896 at Mount Gambier and died at Victor Harbor on 13/11/1967 after suffering a heart attack. He was known as “one of the Jarvis boys” joining in various sporting and local activities and attending school at Victor Harbor. He was born Eric, however was often called Roy or even Bill.
He joined the Australian Imperial Forces in 1915 along with his father and brothers. 5Th Division, Signal Company. No. 3548. Roy was decorated for bravery although he always remained modest about this. He was decorated with the Military Medal and two bars.
<br><br>
He joined the PMG department at Port Elliot as a telegraph messenger when he was 14 years old and transferred to Adelaide living with the Scott family at Thebarton where they owned and ran a general corner store. Here he met Alice Scott and in 1920 after his return from WWI he married Alice and they went by train to Sydney for their honeymoon with very little money. This only goes to show his adventurous nature staying with him all his life. They had two children Keith Scott born in 1923. Keith married Shirley Sanderson and they had three children. Shirley (ed. Jarvis) was born in 1926. Shirley married Gordon Sorensen and they had 3 children..
<br><br>
Roy was a telegraphist with the post office and came home one day and announced that they would be going to Darwin to live. This was in 1923 and Darwin was a small village at the other end of Australia. To travel there you had to firstly catch a train to Melbourne, then Sydney, and a boat then took you around the coast of NSW, Qld. And to the Northern Territory. At that time Alice was pregnant and was advised not to travel until after the birth of her baby. So Roy went on ahead and Alice followed when their son Keith was old enough to travel. They had a wonderful life in primitive conditions, spending two years there before returning to Adelaide. After the birth of their daughter Shirley they again took up another appointment in Darwin. On their return Roy held the position of postmaster at Cook on the Nullarbor Plain, Port Augusta, Ororoo, Port Pirie before returning to Adelaide where Roy was postmaster at Glenelg post office – the largest in the metropolitan area. He retired in July 1961.
<br><br>
Alice adapted to all these outlandish places taking it all in her stride. Both she and Roy
always saw the humorous side of things and lived their lives accordingly. Alice was an
expert cook and excelled at craft and sewing.
<br><br>
They finally retired to Victor Harbor enjoying the area where Roy had spent his boyhood days. They travelled a great deal within Australia in their Morris Minor car. After Roy's death, Alice moved to the city, sold their home and travelled the world. She finally moved to Victoria to be near her daughter Shirley and granddaughters, living in her own unit at the Old Colonist retirement village at Clifton hill. Here she made many friends and continued her craftwork. She did many bus trips around Victoria and managed her own home. At the great age of 96 she gave talks to several groups of people about her life and the early days in Darwin and many other places. She spoke to my Probus group of 100 ladies for an hour, sharing her memories and endearing herself to all. Alice was a very talented lady and lived to be 98 years of age. (2).
<br><br>
Both Peter and I were thrilled to be able to find Auntie Alice here in Melbourne and were privileged to be able to spend time with her in her later years.

Leslie was born at home in Burke Street, Victor Harbor, South Australia on 18/2/1904,
the fifth son of Eliza and Arthur Jarvis. He spent his childhood at Victor Harbor where he gained a love for the sea, which he never lost. He loved the beaches and the surrounding countryside.
<br><br>
The family later lived in Bridge Road near the mouth of the Hindmarsh River which
enabled Les to constantly investigate the area, playing under the bridge and many is the time that he jumped from the bridge into the water below.
<br><br>
Often he accompanied his older brother Keith on his fishing boat, the Vida, along the
nearby coast. Les told many tales of his boyhood days at Victor - I only wish we had
listened more intently so that I could now record accurately his adventures for his
grandchildren.
<br><br>
Times were hard with money constantly in short supply. They had previously lived in
Burke Street near the town center (it has since been demolished). The house was small with one bedroom and a lean-to kitchen which had a dirt floor, no running water and a laundry tub and copper in the back shed.
<br><br>
Les attended school at Victor Harbor and showed a natural ability and interest in the piano. Unfortunately for him, the family did not own a piano nor could they afford to have him taught. As he grew older, and when one was available he would sit and play by ear.
<br><br>
In 1915 when his father, Arthur and three brothers, Keith, Harold and Roy, enlisted in
World War I, Eliza (Gran) was left at home with Reg (who was not accepted in the forces because he had varicose veins), Les and Marjorie.
<br><br>
Arthur Jarvis was the first to return home having been discharged for medical reasons. Roy and Harold returned safely home but sadly his brother Keith died in Suez in 1916 from a fever contracted after swimming in contaminated water near Cario. Les never recovered from the loss of Keith, mourning him for the remainder of his life.
<br><br>
The family moved to Newton Road, Campbelltown, where they worked on a mixed fruit and vegetable block. Les helped financially by working part time at a nearby dairy milking cows. He then went on to work for Horwood Bagshaw as a boilermaker, doing night courses at the School of Mines in Adelaide.
<br><br>
I heard the following story many times from Les as he reminisced later in his life; on
sighting Kathleen Robson alighting from a tram at the Glynde corner, he asked his mates who she was, announcing that he would many her one day. How he managed to accomplish this I do not know as they moved in different social circles, but he did. At first he was not welcomed as a boy friend for Kathleen as the Robsons thought him unsuitable. 
<br><br>
But love has a way of proving people wrong. The Robsons were wonderful caring down-to-earth people and Les was soon accepted into the family circle. Les and Kath were married on 25 August 1922 at the Methodist parsonage, Henley Beach Road, West Adelaide that today would be either Mile End or Thebarton. Witnesses were Henry Binns Robson and Annie Catherine Robson - Kathleen's parents. Leslie's trade was given as “mixed farming” and Kathleen's as a “typist”.
<br><br>
They lived at the home, which Henry Binns Robson had built for his bride Katie Fryer in 1902, at 116 Montacute Road, Hectorville, and named Binnswood”. They had three
children, Leslie David born in 1922, Helen Catherine born in 1924 and Peter James born in 1932.
<br><br>
Before they were married Les had a pushbike and belonged to the local push bike club. He progressed to a small motor bike, purchasing a Harley Davidson and sidecar after he married. The story related to me was that one day Les spun the motor bike around a corner too fast, tipping Kath and baby David out of the sidecar. No one was hurt physically; maybe Les's pride may have been dented! This may have been the end of his motor bike days!
<br><br>
Les kept quite a number of birds in his Aviary - canaries, budgies, finches and kookaburras. It was legal to keep kookaburras in captivity in the mid l930's. The kookas were very friendly and tame. When a gardening session was in progress they were let out of their cage and had a great time hunting for worms. Unfortunately, he developed an allergy for feathers and so he was not able to continue to keep them. Kath knew about native birds - when they would migrate, when they would return. 
<br><br>
She could identify the different species, their habitat, and how many chicks they were likely to raise. No doubt this knowledge was gained from her father and grandfather who ran the orchard. Kath passed this love of birds and nature on to her children.
<br><br>
Les went to work as a foreman for his father-in-law, Henry Robson known affectionately to all the family as “Bope”. The property owned by Thomas Binns Robson and then Henry Binns, was section 280 and consisted at this time of 100 acres. They grew stone fruits, figs and olives, and also owned a nearby vineyard and an orchard in the hills. Cash crops of vegetables were grown between the rows of trees and the surplus fruit and vegetables were taken to the East End market and sold. In the spring a tent community sprung up as students from schools and universities swarmed in to pick the fruit.
<br><br>
Bope and Nannan (as Katie Robson was known to her family) were of the Quaker religion and in running his business Bope, during the depression, kept on all staff members rather than dismiss even one person. He ran into financial difficulties because of this and finally the Bank of Adelaide, with whom they dealt foreclosed in 1934. Leslie and Charlie Robson, son of Henry, entered a scheme of arrangement with the Bank to repay the debt under the trade name of Robson Jarvis & Company. Kath Jarvis ran the office and Les and Charlie took over the factory work involved in running a jam processing business. The fruit was grown in the orchard and processed in the factory. They produced preserved and dried fruits, pickled olives, olive oil and non-alcoholic grape juice.
<br><br>
The Second World War 1939-1945, created a demand for dehydrated vegetables -
particularly potatoes and cabbage - for use in military canteens and field kitchens. Robson Jarvis & Co. successfully tendered for a portion of this business and supplied both Australian and American services. This put them on their feet quickly and the bank loan was repaid. As the equipment and vehicles were supplied free of charge under “The Lend Lease Scheme” by the American Forces there was no looking back. It did, however, take many long hours of labour and intensive work to meet the demands of the Forces. A staff of about 40 was employed during the war, which included 14 Land Army girls who lived in the “Ellythorp” house adjacent to the factory.
<br><br>
As money became available to the partners, and with the bank debt repaid, they purchased what was known as the “Ellythorp block” and a vineyard at the top of Montacute Road.
<br><br>
Charlie made the choice not to purchase any further land whilst Les and Kath purchased the “Cosford block” and invested in small farms at Snowtown in the state's north which they share farmed for many years.
<br><br>
After the war, the factory continued to process fruit, pickled olives and grape juice, using the produce grown in the orchard which had been planted by Kath's grandfather
T.B.Robson. It became a much smaller production line, which Charlie ran on his own,
Kath still working as office manager.
<br><br>
Meanwhile Les in partnership with Edgar Sims built a factory on the “Cosford” block in 1942. They first supplied dehydrated vegetables to the Australian and American troops in conjunction with Robson Jarvis & Co. After the war ended they brought fruit in from
areas along the River Murray and began processing fruit. As much of the orchard had
been subdivided and sold for building blocks, they were no longer able to supply their own fruit.
<br><br>
David Jarvis who had returned from serving with the Airforce, ran this factory for several years.
<br><br>
Helen Jarvis assisted her mother with the general running of the home and in the office until her marriage to Stewart Brougham in 1945.
<br><br>
Les began selling land on the Cosford block and people soon built houses enlarging the population in the area quickly.
<br><br>
Les and Kath bought a block of land at Brighton, planing to build their retirement home close to the sea, which Les loved so much. This did not eventuate and they finally built a new home at 132 Montacute Road. They moved out of Binswood and their son Peter and his family lived there for the first few years of their married life. Binswood was then sold having been in the Robson family for 60 odd years and was demolished to make way for a new home. Henry Binns Robson and his wife Katie, who had been living a Cosford for many years, moved to Ellythorp next to the factory and Cosford was sold. Hemy (Bope) lived on at Ellythorp, after the death of his wife Katie, until his death in 1955,
<br><br>
The Ellythorp block changed, as building blocks were sold, encompassing streets with
houses. (The streets took on family names e.g. Binnswood, Robson, Henry, Watson, Ellythorp, Curtis, Jarvis, Cosford and Katherine.) The S.A. Government purchased 9 acres in 1962 and the building of the Newton Primary School began on the ground that had grown fruit trees from the earliest days of South Australia. The first head master of Newton School was Bert Arthur - Beryl Jarvis's father. He soon had trees planted, playing fields laid, the children enrolled and it became a Class 1 school. Bert and Elva purchased land from Les and built a home at 138 Montacute Road.
<br><br>
Les sold his interest in Fruveg Horticulturist Ltd. and Robson Jarvis closed down. The
factory was sold and demolished to make way for a new housing development. Les and Kath retired and did several trips within Australia. They had as a hobby, photography. Kath took prize winning slides and Les had a movie camera and projector. They joined the “Filmo Club” and shared many happy hours with friends within this Club. They attended conventions in Brisbane, Sydney and Perth also travelling to country towns. They opened their home to club members. They made home movies of family and friends, which are today, a treasure to us all.
<br><br>
Les was a member of the Freemasons Lodge at Payneham and Epworth, becoming Master at Epworth.
<br><br>
In their retirement they enjoyed visiting their families who had moved away from Adelaide. David and Miriam were living at Keith, Helen and Stewart were firstly at Lucindale,
<br><br>
Adelong and finally at Mangrove Mountain near Gosford, whilst Peter and Beryl moved to Mildura, Wagga Wagga, Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne. They loved to drive and visit the beauty spots and towns along the way. As old age crept up on them they learnt to fly especially as Kath's health deteriorated.
<br><br>
Kath suffered several mild strokes making it diffïcult for them to manage to run the house. They were able to find suitable help and stay in their home. Kath died on 1st April 1981 after which Les found life very lonely indeed after their 59 years of marriage.
<br><br>
He stayed on at home, visiting his family whenever he could; David was now living back in Adelaide.
<br><br>
Les became involved in a business venture with an Italian family, which proved disastrous. He went on his first overseas trip to Italy with Ross Zito and saw a little of Europe. He particularly loved Austria. This was a stressfull trip and he returned with back problems.
<br><br>
The association with Ross had begun before Kath's death and was a worry to her. She was an astute business woman and could see the pitfalls that lay ahead. It became a great worry and caused anxiety to Les and to his children, costing him a great deal of money.
<br><br>
However, it was his choice and his life to live the way he wished. This he did regardless of opinions of others and the ultimate outcome. He was a lonely man looking for companionship. Most of his family lived interstate and many friends had died. What he wanted was a constant friend to help fill in the time. He was not slightly interested in joining an elderly club saying that he didn't want to become involved with “old people”.
<br><br>
He celebrated his 80th birthday with a lunch at Terrigal with Helen, Stewart, Peter and
Beryl. A week or so later he visited Peter in Melbourne and celebrated with a party which included both grandchildren and great grandchildren.
<br><br>
He really missed Kath and on the 9th April, 1984 he came home from a meeting with his bank manager, from whom he hadn't received good news, had a heart attack, collapsed and died. He was 80 years old.
<br><br>
Les came from a poor family, had worked hard during his life time, had not had the benefit of a good education nor a happy family home life (before his marriage) as his father was absent for long periods and money was always scarce. His mother worked long hard hours in the home and took in sewing to supplement their income.
<br><br>
Luck helped when World War II brought in the Government contracts helping to repay
bank loans and making enough money to invest in and buy land.
<br><br>
They were most grateful that their son David came home safely from World War II, he
was proud of his children's achievements and loved his grandchildren and great grandchildren. There were 8 grandchildren and 28 great grandchildren.
<br><br>
Les on the whole enjoyed good health, although early in their married life he had his
appendix removed after which there were serious complications. There were several other operations later in life and he developed an allergy to penicillin and dairy foods. These caused swelling of his tongue and face. In his late 70's he developed angina and had tablets to help when necessary. Over all he was a well, strong, healthy man. Only a small man about 5'6 with dark hair and brown eyes - a legacy from his Welsh and Cornish ancestry.
<br><br>
Les and Kath were both cremated and their ashes were scattered, as they had requested, along the banks of Fourth Creek which ran through the edge of their property on Montacute Road.
<br><br>
Their home and remaining property was sold after the death of Les, and so the property, which had originally been purchased by the Robson family for their orchard, passed into other hands.
<br><br>
<b>Helen Kathleen Robson - Jarvis</b>
<br><br>
Kathleen, as she was known, was born on the 12th October, 1903 at Hectorville. She was the first child of Henry and Katie Robson, who lived at “Binswood” on Montacute Road, Hectorville. She lived a privileged lifestyle attending the private school “Poltoonga” in Harrow Road, St. Peters. Afterwards attending Muirden Business College where she successfully completed a shorthand, typing and book-keeping course. Kath worked in the office of the family business, T. B. Robson & Son.
<br><br>
Kath often spoke of her happy childhood, growing up on the Robson property. She rode horses, learnt about nature and how to drive a car. Her grandparents lived nearby and she was brought up in a Quaker home, open at all times to everyone.
<br><br>
After she married in 1922 I have interwoven her life with that of Les and covered her
family life in the “Robson” family history. .
<br><br>
Kath was admired for her determination and strength of character especially after she suffered several strokes. She remained alert and interested in her family. She was a dear, caring little lady who was respected and loved by all.
<br><br>
Our children were fortunate in living within walking distance of their grandparents and
visited them almost daily for the first 10 years of their lives. She was interested in her
grandchildren and always found time to listen to whatever they had to say.
<br><br>

<h3>The children of Les and Kath Jarvis</h3>

<p>
<b>Leslie David Jarvis</b> born on the 23rd December 1922.
<br><br>
David as he is known, lived with his family at “Binswood” on Montacute Road. At that
time the family orchard surrounded the property. David attended Payneharn School, and Norwood High School. He went to the Newton Methodist Church. When he was 15
years old he joined the Shell Company on North Terrace, Adelaide working in the office as a clerk. Here he met Miriam Slade, whom he later married. He joined the Royal
Australian Air Force on the 12 September 1942. He underwent a Pilots' and Navigators' Course at Victor Harbor and Ballarat in Victoria before leaving to serve in New Guinea and Islands in the Pacific. He was discharged in February 1946 with the rank of Flight Lieutenant, having received the Pacific Star. David and Miriam were married in March 1945.
<br><br>
After the war David worked in the family business, managing the Fruveg factory where they were processing fruit; then managed a local garage and petrol station at Payneham, after which he and Miriam moved to Keith where he ran and managed a cattle property for his brother-in-law John Slade. When the property was sold, David and Miriam moved back to Adelaide. David returned to study at Flinders University. enabling him to become a supervisor at the sheltered workshop for handicapped people run by the Phoenix Society at Torrensville until retirement on his 65th birthday.
<br><br>
David and Miriam had two children Mark James and Anne Kathleen. Mark worked for
the Taxation Department and Anne is a Veterinary Surgeon.
<br><br>
There are 7 grandchildren.
<br><br>
<b>Helen Catherine Brougham</b> was born on the 11th September 1924.
<br><br>
Helen was educated at Payneham school and Norwood High School. She attended Newton Methodist Church and later Payneham Methodist Church. As a young girl she loved to keep and care for “creepy-crawly things”, according to her brother Peter. She loved lizards, frogs and insects. She went to Norwood High School and was disappointed when she was not able to continue on with her education because of her mother's health. Helen was required to stay at home and help, later working in the family office at Robson, Jarvis & Co.
<br><br>
She met Stewart Brougham a local Payneham boy and they married in 1945. Stewart
worked firstly as a carpenter, then started his own business in partnership with Jim
Marshall. The company, Marshall & Brougham, was a building company. They lived at
Glenunga for several years then Stewart resigned from the firm and they bought a property at Lucindale in the South East of S.A. Here they cleared the land and ran cattle and grew crops. This was successful and they moved on to a better property at Adelong in NSW.
<br><br>
Next move was to Mangrove Mountain in NSW near Gosford where they bought a smaller property, running fewer cattle and growing flowers on a commercial scale.
<br><br>
Stewart died unexpectedly in 1995 and Helen remains on running the property most
successfully with the help of casual local employees.
<br><br>
Helen fitted into country life in the various places, joining the local Country Women's
Association and taking a leading role, playing tennis, took an active role in the local church activities including the playing of the organ for Sunday services, weddings etc.
<br><br>
Helen and Stewart had four children, Susan, Melanie, Alison and Andrew. All but Alison lives in country areas of NSW. They have 19 grand children.
<br><br>
<b>Peter James Jarvis</b> born on the 2nd December 1932.
<br><br>
Peter also, grew up on the family property, having wide open spaces to wander and play in. He went to Payneham school and the Payneham Methodist Church. In those days most social activities were associated with schools and church. He later went to Adelaide High School and Adelaide Technical School. He spent many hours in the orchard with his grandfather and Uncle Charlie from whom he learnt many practical things. When he was just 16 and old enough to obtain his driving licence he used to drive a truck carting fruit from country areas to the factory at Hectorville, whenever he could. He loved to drive. He spent many of his school holidays on the farm at Snowtown. Here his parents were share-farmers with the Stevens family who became the best of friends. It was here that he rode horses, drove tractors and helped generally with work on the farm.
<br><br>
He was fortunate as his parents, especially after the War, were comfortably off financially, something they had not been for the two older children. He had his first motor bike, a BSA when he was 16, a sports car a Ford Anglia when he was 18, a Singer sports car at 19.
<br><br>
He went to Work at Dalgety's a Ford distributor in Adelaide. He then sold Holden and
second hand cars at the family business at Payneham. The lure of the motor vehicle took him to drive for Coca Cola all over the State, finally managing depots in Mildura and Sales Manager in Wagga Wagga.
<br><br>
He moved to Sydney where he joined Golden Fleece as a sales representative working in all country areas over a period of several years. He transferred back to Adelaide with the firm and it was thought this would be the last move. But promotion came along as Sales Manager in Melbourne, which he accepted. He was soon promoted to State Manager where he remained until a takeover bid terminated many employees including Peter.
<br><br>
He ventured into a business partnership in advertising electronic signs and finally managed a fuel depot before retiring. During these years he was fortunate enough to do several overseas business trips. Previously he and Beryl had been able to have four overseas trips.
<br><br>
After retirement they bought a large caravan and four wheel drive and travelled to
outback areas and towns discovering our wonderful country scenery. This they did for
several years loving every minute of it. They are now living in suburban Melbourne.
<br><br>
Peter and Beryl were married in 1952 and have two children Jennifer and Steven. They have 4 grandchildren.

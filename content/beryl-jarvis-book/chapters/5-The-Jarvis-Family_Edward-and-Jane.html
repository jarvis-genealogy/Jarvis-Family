</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denbigh">Denbigh</a> is an important market town pleasantly situated in the center of the Vale of Clywd, 17 klms from Rhyl and 60 klms from Chester. It was granted by Edward I to the Earl of Lindon who built a wall around the town and commenced building a castle in the year 1252.
<br><br>
The ruins of Denbigh Castle(AM) are a reminder of the particularly fierce resistance which successive English rulers met in these parts of Wales. The boundary of the castle is still marked by high walls and 8 towers, most of them ruined though the entrance gatehouse and the adjoining tower are still standing. The ancient market town itself was originally walled but after being burnt down twice in the 15th century, it was rebuilt outside the walls. The town’s landmark is the 16th century ruin known as Leicester’s Folly (<b>AM</b>), meant to be a cathedral but never completed.
<br><br>
North of the town is Plas Clough built more than three centuries ago by Sir Richard Clough who assisted Sir Thomas Greshamto establish the Royal Exchange. An English family named Clough lived in Denbigh in the 16th and 17th centuries and became patrons of bards. Reference to them in bardic verse are as "Clugh" <b>(2)</b>.
<br><br>

<b>COINCIDENCE</b>
<br><br>
Whilst researching the "ROBSON" family history I found they were descended from a Hugh Clough who had been the High Sherrif of Denbigh in the 1600's.
<br><br>
There is no known relationship between this family and the Jarvis "Clan", however both families did live in the same area albeit many years apart.
<br><br>
Some 300 years later and 19,000 klms away in another country Kathleen Robson married Leslie Douglas Jarvis.
<br><br>
The Clough family history from the 16th to the 20th century is on the following page.

Richard Clough of Denbigh, Wales married a Miss Whittingham of Chester belonging to a Puritan family of Chester, and said to have been related to Calvin.

(<b>3</b>) MONMOUTH, Powys - At the place which is now called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouth">Monmouth</a>, the Romans established a military base called Blestium. Several centuries later, the Normans built a castle, which was eventually destroyed during the Civil War, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monnow_Bridge">Monmouth Bridge</a>, is a fascinating survival, the only Norman fortified bridge remaining in Britain.

<p>
Its 13th century tower formed one of the four medieval gates to the town. The castle was the birthplace of the future Henry V. A statue on the 18th century Shire Hall serves as a reminder. Monmouth's second most famous son was born in 1877, C.S. Rolls, who is one half of the famous partnership of Rolls-Royce. Places of interest include the Naval Temple on Kymin Hill, a pantheon to a galaxy of admirals and naval heroes.

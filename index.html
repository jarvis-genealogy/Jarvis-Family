<H3>A record of the Jarvis family in Australia</H3>

<br>

<p style="background: Gainsboro; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
This record is  compiled primarily for the interests of families descended from Joshua Jarvis (1832-1877) and Mary Ann Barrett (1839-1913) of Victor Harbor and Jamestown in South Australia.
<br><br>
My Aunt Beryl writes : <i>On the 10th June, 1851 the sailing ship “Reliance” sailed from Plymouth and on borad was a 19 year old young man with the name of Joshua Jarvis travelling unaccompanied.</i> On board also was the Barrett family and Mary Ann.<br><br>
One of their sons, Arthur Harold, married Eliza Jane James. Their son, Eric Roy, married Alice May Scott who were my grandparents. Their son, Keith Scott, and Shirley Mary Sanderson were my parents.

<br><br>
An interview by Neil Quintrell with my Grandmother Alice about their experiences in Cook. Eric Roy was a telegraphist and they moved to Cook as part of the repeater station there. Cook was on the Trans-Australian Railway line. Other repeaters were in Rawlinna to the West and Tarcoola to the East.
<br><br>
Neil was son of Norman Quintrell and Olive (Ollie), Alice's sister and he typed the interview from an audio tape recording. I have transcribed these and included some photos and informative links.

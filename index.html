<H3>A record of the Jarvis family in Australia</H3>
<br>

<p style="background: Gainsboro; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
This record is  compiled primarily for the interests of families descended from Joshua Jarvis (1832-1877) and Mary Ann Barrett (1839-1913) of Victor Harbor and Jamestown in South Australia.<br><br>

My Aunt Beryl writes : <i>On the 10th June, 1851 the sailing ship “Reliance” sailed from Plymouth and on borad was a 19 year old young man with the name of Joshua Jarvis travelling unaccompanied.</i> On board also was the Barrett family and Mary Ann.<br><br>
One of their sons, Arthur Harold, married Eliza Jane James. Their son, Eric Roy, married Alice May Scott who were my grandparents. Their son, Keith Scott, and Shirley Mary Sanderson were my parents.
<br><br>
I will add material as I get it together.

<h3>The Jarvis family tree</h3>

<br><br>
Although the descendancy chart here is not finished and accuracy of names and dates is yet to be explored, it nevertheless gives an overview. Documents, photographs and other material of interest will be included.
<br><br>
You may notice blue squares at the left margin. Moving the cursor over these will bring up thumbnail images. Click on the square to bring up the particular image or document. Click the "Back" button at the top of the browser to return to the chart.<br>

<h3>Family history</h3>

<a href="content\Cook-Stories.html" target="blank"><b>Recollections of Cook on the Nullarbor plain in the early 30's</b></a>
<br><br>
An interview by Neil Quintrell with my Grandmother Alice about their experiences in Cook. Eric Roy was a telegraphist and they moved to Cook as part of the repeater station there. Cook was on the Trans-Australian Railway line. Other repeaters were in Rawlinna to the West and Tarcoola to the East.
<br><br>
Neil was son of Norman Quintrell and Olive (Ollie), Alice's sister and he typed the interview from an audio tape recording. I have transcribed these and included some photos and informative links.
<br><br> 
As more material is ready, I will add it here.

<br>
With the primary aim of backup, the descendency charts for the Jarvis and Scott families have been reproduced in a more traditional manner using a genealogy application for Windows <a href="https://chronoplexsoftware.com/myfamilytree/index.htm">"My Family Tree"</a> by Chronoplex Software and exported as a <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEDCOM">GEDCOM</a> file. This can be imported into any software that supports the format. However, pages for individuals and links to further information are not included.
<br><br>
Three are several GEDCOM formats and the one provided here is GEDCOM 5.5.1 for compatibility with older software. Download the archive
 <a href = "https://github.com/jarvis-genealogy/Jarvis-Family/raw/main/content/gedcom/Jarvis_mft-5_5.zip">here</a>, unzip and import Jarvis_mft.ged.

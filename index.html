<H3>A record of the Jarvis family in Australia</H3>
<br>

<p style="background: Gainsboro; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
This record is compiled primarily for the interests of families descended from Joshua Jarvis and Mary Ann Barrett of Victor Harbor and Jamestown.<br><br>

My Aunt Beryl writes : <i>On the 10th June, 1851 the sailing ship “Reliance” sailed from Plymouth and on borad was a 19 year old young man with the name of Joshua Jarvis travelling unaccompanied.</i> On board also was the Barrett family and Mary Ann.<br><br>
One of their sons, Arthur Harold, married Eliza Jane James. Their son, Eric Roy, married Alice May Scott who were my grandparents. Their son, Keith Scott, and Shirley Mary Sanderson were my parents.
<br><br>
This record is just a start and I will add material as I get it together.

<h3>The Jarvis family tree</h3>

<a href="content\jarvis-tree.html" target="blank"><b>The interactive family tree</b></a>
<br><br>
The descendancy chart here is just a start and nowhere near finished or complete. Names and dates are almost certainly not accurate and there is much more material to be added. But for now it gives some idea.
<br><br>
The chart will be arranged with links to documents and other material of interest. Where available, letters, explanations, photographs and other material will be retrieved by clicking on the particular family member. You may notice blue squares at the left margin. Moving the cursor over these will bring up thumbnail images. Click on the square to bring up the particular image or document. Click the "Back" button at the top of the browser to return to the chart.

<h3>Family history</h3>

<br>
<a href="content\Cook-Stories.html" target="blank"><b>Recollections of Cook on the Nullarbor plain in the early 30's</b></a>
<br><br>
An interview by Neil Quintrel with my Grandmother Alice about their experiences in Cook. Eric Roy was a telegraphist and they moved to Cook as part of the repeater station there. Cook was on the Trans-Australian Railway line. Other repeaters were in Rawlinna to the West and Tarcoola to the East.
<br><br>
Neil was son of Norman Quintrell and Olive (Ollie), Alice's sister and typed the interview from an audio tape recording. I have transcribed the typed pages together with some photos and informative links.
<br><br> 
As more material is ready, I will add it here.

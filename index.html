<H3>A record of the Jarvis family in Australia</H3>
<br>

<p style="background: Gainsboro; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
This record is  compiled primarily for the interests of families descended from Joshua Jarvis (1832-1877) and Mary Ann Barrett (1839-1913) of Victor Harbor and Jamestown in South Australia.<br><br>

My Aunt Beryl writes : <i>On the 10th June, 1851 the sailing ship “Reliance” sailed from Plymouth and on borad was a 19 year old young man with the name of Joshua Jarvis travelling unaccompanied.</i> On board also was the Barrett family and Mary Ann.<br><br>
One of their sons, Arthur Harold, married Eliza Jane James. Their son, Eric Roy, married Alice May Scott who were my grandparents. Their son, Keith Scott, and Shirley Mary Sanderson were my parents.
<br><br>
I will add material as I get it together.

<h3>The Jarvis family tree</h3>

<p style="background: palegoldenrod; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
<br>
<a href="content\jarvis-tree.html" target="blank"><b>The interactive family tree</b></a>
<br><br>
Although the descendancy chart here is not finished and accuracy of names and dates is yet to be explored, it nevertheless gives an overview. Documents, photographs and other material of interest will be included.
<br><br>
You may notice blue squares at the left margin. Moving the cursor over these will bring up thumbnail images. Click on the square to bring up the particular image or document. Click the "Back" button at the top of the browser to return to the chart.<br>

<h3>Family history</h3>

<p style="background: palegoldenrod; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
<br>
<a href="content\Cook-Stories.html" target="blank"><b>Recollections of Cook on the Nullarbor plain in the early 30's</b></a>
<br><br>
An interview by Neil Quintrell with my Grandmother Alice about their experiences in Cook. Eric Roy was a telegraphist and they moved to Cook as part of the repeater station there. Cook was on the Trans-Australian Railway line. Other repeaters were in Rawlinna to the West and Tarcoola to the East.
<br><br>
Neil was son of Norman Quintrell and Olive (Ollie), Alice's sister and he typed the interview from an audio tape recording. I have transcribed these and included some photos and informative links.
<br><br> 
As more material is ready, I will add it here.
<br><br>

<h3>Photos</h3>

<p style="background: palegoldenrod; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
<br>
<a href="content\jarvis-tree\images\jarvis-album.html" target="blank"><b>Album of collected photos</b></a>
<br><br>
Order is alphabetic and more will be added as they are discovered.

<h3>Archive</h3>

<br><br>
Why GitHub?<br><br>
<a href = "https://github.com/" target="blank">GitHub</a> is a hosting site for repositories where developers and programmers can upload code and work on it collaboratively. The version control system allows any changes to be traced. Projects are open-source and can be made open to the public. This web-page is itself a programming project using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="blank">html</a> and <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="blank">css</a>. You can download it complete or explore the various folders, files and images. Web-pages can also be generated and hosted by GitHub so that a separate hosting service is not necessary.<br><br>
Why bother?<br><br>
I wanted to create an open-source record independent of any service, paid or otherwise, either for creating a Family Tree or simply hosting a web-site. The reason is simple. If paid, when the subscription expires so does the record. Even if the hosting service is free, the record is lost if the service is changed or no longer available. The same problem exists if other software is used to create the pages.<br><br>

Pros and cons<br><br>
The downside is that the pages have a plain look, the descendancy charts do not offer all the features of hosted services and it's not as simple to create and maintain. But you don't have to sign up for anything, the pages are self-contained. Public access to the source and multiple authors ensure that the record is never lost and will last as long as GitHub itself and the use of html
